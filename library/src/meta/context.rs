/// Provides access to the location of content.
///
/// This is useful in combination with [queries]($func/query),
/// [counters]($func/counter), [state]($func/state), and [links]($func/link).
/// See their documentation for more details.
///
/// ```example
/// #locate(loc => [
///   My location: \
///   #loc.position()!
/// ])
/// ```
///
/// ## Methods
/// ### page()
/// Return the page number for this location.
///
/// Note that this does not return the value of the [page counter]($func/counter)
/// at this location, but the true page number (starting from one).
///
/// If you want to know the value of the page counter, use
/// `{counter(page).at(loc)}` instead.
///
/// - returns: integer
///
/// ### position()
/// Return a dictionary with the page number and the x, y position for this
/// location. The page number starts at one and the coordinates are measured
/// from the top-left of the page.
///
/// If you only need the page number, use `page()` instead as it allows Typst
/// to skip unnecessary work.
///
/// - returns: dictionary
///
/// ### page-numbering()
/// Returns the page numbering pattern of the page at this location. This can be
/// used when displaying the page counter in order to obtain the local numbering.
/// This is useful if you are building custom indices or outlines.
///
/// If the page numbering is set to `none` at that location, this function returns `none`.
///
/// - returns: string or function or none

/// (width and height).
///
/// The given function must accept a single parameter, `size`, which is a
/// dictionary with keys `width` and `height`, both of type
/// [`length`]($type/length).
///

/// ```example
/// #let text = lorem(30)
/// #layout(size => style(styles => [
///   #let (height,) = measure(
///     block(width: size.width, text),
///     styles,
///   )
///   This text is #height high with
///   the current page width: \
///   #text
/// ]))
/// ```
///
/// If the `layout` call is placed inside of a box width a width of `{800pt}`
/// and a height of `{400pt}`, then the specified function will be given the
/// parameter `{(width: 800pt, height: 400pt)}`. If it placed directly into the
/// page it receives the page's dimensions minus its margins. This is mostly
/// useful in combination with [measurement]($func/measure).
///
/// You can also use this function to resolve [`ratio`]($type/ratio) to fixed
/// lengths. This might come in handy if you're building your own layout
/// abstractions.
///
/// ```example
/// #layout(size => {
///   let half = 50% * size.width
///   [Half a page is #half wide.]
/// })
/// ```
///
/// Note that this function will provide an infinite width or height if one of
/// the page width or height is `auto`, respectively.
