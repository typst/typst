/// Provides access to the location of content.
///
/// This is useful in combination with [queries]($func/query),
/// [counters]($func/counter), [state]($func/state), and [links]($func/link).
/// See their documentation for more details.
///
/// ```example
/// #locate(loc => [
///   My locatation: \
///   #loc.position()!
/// ])
/// ```
///
/// ## Methods
/// ### page()
/// Return the page number for this location.
///
/// Note that this does not return the value of the [page counter]($func/counter)
/// at this location, but the true page number (starting from one).
///
/// If you want to know the value of the page counter, use
/// `{counter(page).at(loc)}` instead.
///
/// - returns: integer
///
/// ### position()
/// Return a dictionary with the page number and the x, y position for this
/// location. The page number starts at one and the coordinates are measured
/// from the top-left of the page.
///
/// If you only need the page number, use `page()` instead as it allows Typst
/// to skip unnecessary work.
///
/// - returns: dictionary
///
/// ### page-numbering()
/// Returns the page numbering pattern of the page at this location. This can be
/// used when displaying the page counter in order to obtain the local numbering.
/// This is useful if you are building custom indices or outlines.
///
/// If the page numbering is set to `none` at that location, this function returns `none`.
///
/// - returns: string or function or none

/// Provides access to the current outer container's (or page's, if none) size (width and height).
///
/// The given function must accept a single parameter, `size`, which is a dictionary with keys
/// `width` and `height`, both having the type [`length`]($type/length).
///
/// That is, if this `layout` call is done inside (for example) a box of size 800pt (width)
/// by 400pt (height), then the specified function will be given the parameter
/// `(width: 800pt, height: 400pt)`.
///
/// If, however, this `layout` call is placed directly on the page, not inside any container,
/// then the function will be given `(width: page_width, height: page_height)`, where `page_width`
/// and `page_height` correspond to the current page's respective dimensions, minus its margins.
///
/// This is useful, for example, to convert a [`ratio`]($type/ratio) value (such as `5%`, `100%`
/// etc.), which are usually based upon the outer container's dimensions (precisely what this
/// function gives), to a fixed length (in `pt`).
///
/// This is also useful if you're trying to make content fit a certain box, and doing certain
/// arithmetic using `pt` (for example, comparing different lengths) is required.
///
/// Please note: This function may provide a width or height of `infpt` if one of the page
/// dimensions is `auto`, under certain circumstances. This should not normally occur for
/// usual page sizes, however.
///
/// ```example
/// layout(size => {
///     // work with the width and height of the container we're in
///     // using size.width and size.height
/// })
///
/// layout(size => {
///     // convert 49% (of page width) to 'pt'
///     // note that "ratio" values are always relative to a certain, possibly arbitrary length,
///     // but it's usually the current container's width or height (e.g., for table columns,
///     // 15% would be relative to the width, but, for rows, it would be relative to the height).
///     let percentage_of_width = (49% / 1%) * 0.01 * size.width
///     // ... use the converted value ...
/// })
///
/// // The following two boxes are equivalent, and will have rectangles sized 200pt and 40pt:
///
/// #box(width: 200pt, height: 40pt, {
///     rect(width: 100%, height: 100%)
/// })

///     rect(width: size.width, height: size.height)
/// }))
