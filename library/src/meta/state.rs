/// Manage stateful parts of your document.
///
/// Let's say you have some computations in your document and want to remember
/// the result of your last computation to use it in the next one. You might try
/// something similar the code below and would expect it to output 10, 13, 26,
/// and 21. However this **does not work** in Typst. If you test this code, you
/// will see that Typst complains with the following error message: _Variables
/// from outside the function are read-only and cannot be modified._
///
/// ```typ
/// #let x = 0
/// #let compute(expr) = {
///   x = eval(
///     expr.replace("x", str(x))
///   )
///   [New value is #x. ]
/// }
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// #compute("x * 2") \
/// #compute("x - 5")
/// ```
///
/// ## State and document markup { #state-and-markup }
/// Why does it do that? Because, in general, this kind of computation with side
/// effects is problematic in document markup and Typst is upfront about that.
/// For the results to make sense, the computation must proceed in the same
/// order in which the results will be laid out in the document. In our simple
/// example, that's the case, but in general it might not be.
///
/// Let's look at a slightly different, but similar kind of state: The heading
/// numbering. We want to increase the heading counter at each heading. Easy
/// enough, right? Just add one. Well, it's not that simple. Consider the
/// following example:
///
/// ```example
/// #set heading(numbering: "1.")
/// #let template(body) = [
///   = Outline
///   ...
///   #body
/// ]
///
/// #show: template
///
/// = Introduction
/// ...
/// ```
///
/// Here, Typst first processes the body of the document after the show rule,
/// sees the `Introduction` heading, then passes the resulting content to the
/// `template` function and only then sees the `Outline`. Just counting up would
/// number the `Introduction` with `1` and the `Outline` with `2`.
///
/// ## Managing state in Typst { #state-in-typst }
/// So what do we do instead? We use Typst's state management system. Calling
/// the `state` function with an identifying string key and an optional initial
/// value gives you a state value which exposes a few methods. The two most
/// important ones are `display` and `update`:
///
/// - The `display` method shows the current value of the state. You can
///   optionally give it a function that receives the value and formats it in
///   some way.
///
/// - The `update` method modifies the state. You can give it any value. If
///   given a non-function value, it sets the state to that value. If given a
///   function, that function receives the previous state and has to return the
///   new state.
///
/// Our initial example would now look like this:
///
/// ```example
/// #let s = state("x", 0)
/// #let compute(expr) = [
///   #s.update(x =>
///     eval(expr.replace("x", str(x)))
///   )
///   New value is #s.display().
/// ]
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// #compute("x * 2") \
/// #compute("x - 5")
/// ```
///
/// State managed by Typst is always updated in layout order, not in evaluation
/// order. The `update` method returns content and its effect occurs at the
/// position where the returned content is inserted into the document.
///
/// As a result, we can now also store some of the computations in
/// variables, but they still show the correct results:
///
/// ```example
/// >>> #let s = state("x", 0)
/// >>> #let compute(expr) = [
/// >>>   #s.update(x =>
/// >>>     eval(expr.replace("x", str(x)))
/// >>>   )
/// >>>   New value is #s.display().
/// >>> ]
/// <<< ...
///
/// #let more = [
///   #compute("x * 2") \
///   #compute("x - 5")
/// ]
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// #more
/// ```
///
/// This example is of course a bit silly, but in practice this is often exactly
/// what you want! A good example are heading counters, which is why Typst's
/// [counting system]($func/counter) is very similar to its state system.
///
/// ## Time Travel { #time-travel }
/// By using Typst's state management system you also get time travel
/// capabilities! By combining the state system with [`locate`]($func/locate)
/// and [`query`]($func/query), we can find out what the value of the state will
/// be at any position in the document from anywhere else. In particular, the
/// `at` method gives us the value of the state at any location and the `final`
/// methods gives us the value of the state at the end of the document.
///
/// ```example
/// >>> #let s = state("x", 0)
/// >>> #let compute(expr) = [
/// >>>   #s.update(x => {
/// >>>     eval(expr.replace("x", str(x)))
/// >>>   })
/// >>>   New value is #s.display().
/// >>> ]
/// <<< ...
///
/// Value at `<here>` is
/// #locate(loc => s.at(
///   query(<here>, loc)
///     .first()
///     .location()
/// ))
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// *Here.* <here> \
/// #compute("x * 2") \
/// #compute("x - 5")
/// ```
///
/// ## A word of caution { #caution }
/// To resolve the values of all states, Typst evaluates parts of your code
/// multiple times. However, there is no guarantee that your state manipulation
/// can actually be completely resolved.
///
/// For instance, if you generate state updates depending on the final value of
/// a state, the results might never converge. The example below illustrates
/// this. We initialize our state with `1` and then update it to its own final
/// value plus 1. So it should be `2`, but then its final value is `2`, so it
/// should be `3`, and so on. This example display `4` because Typst simply
/// gives up after a few attempts.
///
/// ```example
/// #let s = state("x", 1)
/// #locate(loc => {
///   s.update(s.final(loc) + 1)
/// })
/// #s.display()
/// ```
///
/// In general, you should _typically_ not generate state updates from within
/// `locate` calls or `display` calls of state or counters. Instead pass a
/// function to `update` that determines the value of the state based on its
/// previous value.
///
/// ## Methods
/// ### display()
/// Display the value of the state.
///
/// - format: function (positional)
///   A function which receives the value of the state and can return arbitrary
///   content which is then displayed. If this is omitted, the value is directly
///   displayed.
///
/// - returns: content
///
/// ### update()
/// Update the value of the state.
///
/// The update will be in effect at the position where the returned content is
/// inserted into the document. If you don't put the output into the document,
/// nothing happens! This would be the case, for example, if you write
/// `{let _ = state("key").update(7)}`. State updates are always applied in
/// layout order and in that case, Typst wouldn't know when to update the state.
///
/// - value: any or function (positional, required)
///   If given a non function-value, sets the state to that value. If given a
///   function, that function receives the previous state and has to return the
///   new state.
///
/// - returns: content
///
/// ### at()
/// Get the value of the state at the given location.
///
/// - location: location (positional, required)
///   The location at which the state's value should be retrieved. A suitable
///   location can be retrieved from [`locate`]($func/locate) or
///   [`query`]($func/query).
///
/// - returns: any
///
/// ### final()
/// Get the value of the state at the end of the document.
///
/// - location: location (positional, required)
///   Can be any location. Why is it required then? As noted before, Typst has
///   to evaluate parts of your code multiple times to determine the values of
///   all state. By only allowing this method within [`locate`]($func/locate)
///   calls, the amount of code that can depend on the method's result is
///   reduced. If you could call `final` directly at the top level of a module,
///   the evaluation of the whole module and its exports could depend on the
///   state's value.
///
/// - returns: any
