/// Find elements in the document.
///
/// The `query` functions lets you search your document for elements of a
/// particular type or with a particular label.
///
/// To use it, you first need to retrieve the current document location with the
/// [`locate`]($func/locate) function. You can then decide whether you want to
/// find all elements, just the ones before that location, or just the ones
/// after it.
///
/// ## Finding elements { #finding-elements }
/// In the example below, we create a custom page header that displays the text
/// "Typst Academy" in small capitals and the current section title. On the
/// first page, the section title is omitted because the header is before the
/// first section heading.
///
/// To realize this layout, we call `locate` and then query for all headings
/// after the current location. The function we pass to locate is called twice
/// in this case: Once per page.
///
/// - On the first page the query for all headings before the current location
///   yields an empty array: There are no previous headings. We check for this
///   case and and just display "Typst Academy".
///
/// - For the second page, we retrieve the last element from the query's result.
///   This is the latest heading before the current position and as such, it is
///   the heading of the section we are currently in. We access its content
///   through the `body` field and display it alongside "Typst Academy".
///
/// ```example
/// >>> #set page(
/// >>>   width: 240pt,
/// >>>   height: 180pt,
/// >>>   margin: (top: 35pt, rest: 15pt),
/// >>>   header-ascent: 12pt,
/// >>> )
/// #set page(header: locate(loc => {
///   let elems = query(
///     selector(heading).before(loc),
///     loc,
///   )
///   let academy = smallcaps[
///     Typst Academy
///   ]
///   if elems == () {
///     align(right, academy)
///   } else {
///     let body = elems.last().body
///     academy + h(1fr) + emph(body)
///   }
/// }))
///

/// #lorem(23)

///
/// ## A word of caution { #caution }
/// To resolve all your queries, Typst evaluates and layouts parts of the
/// document multiple times. However, there is no guarantee that your queries
/// can actually be completely resolved. If you aren't careful a query can
/// affect itselfâ€”leading to a result that never stabilizes.
///
/// In the example below, we query for all headings in the document. We then
/// generate as many headings. In the beginning, there's just one heading,
/// titled `Real`. Thus, `count` is `1` and one `Fake` heading is generated.
/// Typst sees that the query's result has changed and processes it again. This
/// time, `count` is `2` and two `Fake` headings are generated. This goes on and
/// on. As we can see, the output has five headings. This is because Typst
/// simply gives up after five attempts.
///
/// In general, you should try not to write queries that affect themselves.
/// The same words of caution also apply to other introspection features like
/// [counters]($func/counter) and [state]($func/state).
///
/// ```example
/// = Real
/// #locate(loc => {
///   let elems = query(heading, loc)
///   let count = elems.len()
///   count * [= Fake]
/// })
/// ```
///
/// ## Migration Hints { #migration-hints }
/// The `before` and `after` arguments have been removed in version 0.3.0. You
/// can now use flexible selector combinator methods instead. For example,
/// `query(heading, before: loc)` becomes `query(heading.before(loc), loc)`.
/// Please refer to the [selector documentation]($type/selector) for more
/// details.

    /// Currently, only a subset of element functions is supported. Aside from
    /// headings and figures, this includes equations, references and all
    /// elements with an explicit label. As a result, you _can_ query for e.g.
    /// [`strong`]($func/strong) elements, but you will find only those that
