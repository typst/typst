- name: variants
  display: Variants
  functions: ["serif", "sans", "frak", "mono", "bb", "cal"]
  description: |
    Alternate typefaces within formulas.

    These functions are distinct from the [`text`]($func/text) function because
    math fonts contain multiple variants of each letter.

- name: styles
  display: Styles
  functions: ["upright", "italic", "bold"]
  description: |
    Alternate letterforms within formulas.

    These functions are distinct from the [`text`]($func/text) function because
    math fonts contain multiple variants of each letter.

- name: sizes
  display: Sizes
  functions: ["display", "inline", "script", "sscript"]
  description: |
    Forced size styles for expressions within formulas.

    These functions allow manual configuration of the size of equation elements
    to make them look as in a display/inline equation or as if used in a root or
    sub/superscripts.

- name: underover
  display: Under/Over
  functions: [
    "underline",
    "overline",
    "underbrace",
    "overbrace",
    "underbracket",
    "overbracket",
  ]
  description: |
    Delimiters above or below parts of an equation.

    The braces and brackets further allow you to add an optional annotation
    below or above themselves.

- name: roots
  display: Roots
  functions: ["root", "sqrt"]
  description: Square and non-square roots.

- name: attach
  display: Attach
  functions: ["attach", "scripts", "limits"]
  description: |
    Subscript, superscripts, and limits.

    The `attach` function backs the `[$a_b^c$]` syntax that adds top and bottom
    attachments to a part of an equation. Attachments can be displayed either as
    sub/superscripts, or limits. Typst automatically decides which is more
    suitable depending on the base, but you can also control this manually with
    the `scripts` and `limits` functions.

- name: lr
  display: Left/Right
  functions: ["lr", "abs", "norm", "floor", "ceil", "round"]
  description: |
    Delimiter matching.

    The `lr` function allows you to match two delimiters and scale them with the
    content they contain. While this also happens automatically for delimiters
    that match syntactically, `lr` allows you to match two arbitrary delimiters
    and control their size exactly. Apart from the `lr` function, Typst provides
    a few more functions that create delimiter pairings for absolute, ceiled,
    and floored values as well as norms.
