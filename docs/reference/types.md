# None
A value that indicates the absence of any other value.

The none type has exactly one value: `{none}`.

When inserted into the document, it is not visible.
This is also the value that is produced by empty code blocks.
It can be [joined]($scripting/#blocks) with any value, yielding
the other value.

## Example
```example
Not visible: #none
```

# Auto
A value that indicates a smart default.

The auto type has exactly one value: `{auto}`.

Parameters that support the `{auto}` value have some smart default or contextual
behaviour. A good example is the [text direction]($func/text.dir) parameter.
Setting it to `{auto}` lets Typst automatically determine the direction from the
[text language]($func/text.lang).

# Boolean
Either `{true}` or `{false}`.

The boolean type has two values: `{true}` and `{false}`. It denotes whether
something is active or enabled.

## Example
```example
#false \
#true \
#(1 < 2)
```

# Integer
A whole number.

The number can be negative, zero, or positive. As Typst uses 64 bits to store
integers, integers cannot be smaller than `{-9223372036854775808}` or larger than
`{9223372036854775807}`.

The number can also be specified as hexadecimal, octal, or binary by starting it
with a zero followed by either `x`, `o`, or `b`.

You can convert a value to an integer with the [`int`]($func/int) function.

## Example
```example
#(1 + 2) \
#(2 - 5) \
#(3 + 4 < 8)

#0xff \
#0o10 \
#0b1001
```

# Float
A floating-pointer number.

A limited-precision representation of a real number. Typst uses 64 bits to
store floats. Wherever a float is expected, you can also pass an
[integer]($type/integer).

You can convert a value to a float with the [`float`]($func/float) function.

## Example
```example
#3.14 \
#1e4 \
#(10 / 4)
```

# Length
A size or distance, possibly expressed with contextual units.
Typst supports the following length units:

- Points: `{72pt}`
- Millimeters: `{254mm}`
- Centimeters: `{2.54cm}`
- Inches: `{1in}`
- Relative to font size: `{2.5em}`

A length has the following fields:

- `abs`: A length with just the absolute component of the current length
(that is, excluding the `em` component).
- `em`: The amount of `em` units in this length, as a [float]($type/float).

You can multiply lengths with and divide them by integers and floats.

## Example
```example
#rect(width: 20pt)
#rect(width: 2em)
#rect(width: 1in)

#(3em + 5pt).em
#(20pt).em

#(40em + 2pt).abs
#(5em).abs
```

## Methods
### pt()
Converts this length to points.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero `em` units (such as `5em + 2pt`
instead of just `2pt`). Use the `abs` field (such as in `(5em + 2pt).abs.pt()`)
to ignore the `em` component of the length (thus converting only its absolute
component).

- returns: float

### mm()
Converts this length to millimeters.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero `em` units (such as `5em + 2pt`
instead of just `2pt`). See the [`pt`]($type/float.pt) method for more info.

- returns: float

### cm()
Converts this length to centimeters.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero `em` units (such as `5em + 2pt`
instead of just `2pt`). See the [`pt`]($type/float.pt) method for more info.

- returns: float

### inches()
Converts this length to inches.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero `em` units (such as `5em + 2pt`
instead of just `2pt`). See the [`pt`]($type/float.pt) method for more info.

- returns: float

# Angle
An angle describing a rotation.
Typst supports the following angular units:

- Degrees: `{180deg}`
- Radians: `{3.14rad}`

## Example
```example
#rotate(10deg)[Hello there!]
```

## Methods
### deg()
Converts this angle to degrees.

- returns: float

### rad()
Converts this angle to radians.

- returns: float

# Ratio
A ratio of a whole.

Written as a number, followed by a percent sign.

## Example
```example
#set align(center)
#scale(x: 150%)[
  Scaled apart.
]
```

# Relative Length
A length in relation to some known length.

This type is a combination of a [length]($type/length) with a
[ratio]($type/ratio). It results from addition and subtraction
of a length and a ratio. Wherever a relative length is expected, you can also
use a bare length or ratio.

A relative length has the following fields:
- `length`: Its length component.
- `ratio`: Its ratio component.

## Example
```example
#rect(width: 100% - 50pt)

#(100% - 50pt).length
#(100% - 50pt).ratio
```

# Fraction
Defines how the the remaining space in a layout is distributed.

Each fractionally sized element gets space based on the ratio of its fraction to
the sum of all fractions.

For more details, also see the [h]($func/h) and [v]($func/v) functions and the
[grid function]($func/grid).

## Example
```example
Left #h(1fr) Left-ish #h(2fr) Right
```

# Color
A color in a specific color space.

Typst supports:
- sRGB through the [`rgb` function]($func/rgb)
- Device CMYK through [`cmyk` function]($func/cmyk)
- D65 Gray through the [`luma` function]($func/luma)

Furthermore, Typst provides the following built-in colors:

`black`, `gray`, `silver`, `white`, `navy`, `blue`, `aqua`, `teal`, `eastern`,
`purple`, `fuchsia`, `maroon`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `olive`, `green`, and
`lime`.

## Methods
### kind()
Returns the constructor function for this color's kind
([`rgb`]($func/rgb), [`cmyk`]($func/cmyk) or [`luma`]($func/luma)).

```example
#let color = cmyk(1%, 2%, 3%, 4%)
#(color.kind() == cmyk)
```

- returns: function

### lighten()
Lightens a color.

- amount: ratio (positional, required)
  The factor to lighten the color by.
- returns: color

### darken()
Darkens a color.

- amount: ratio (positional, required)
  The factor to darken the color by.
- returns: color

### negate()
Produces the negative of the color.

- returns: color

### hex()
Returns the color's RGB(A) hex representation (such as `#ffaa32` or `#020304fe`).

to `ff` (255 / 100%).

- returns: string

### rgba()
Converts this color to sRGB and returns its components (R, G, B, A) as an array
of [integers]($type/integer).

- returns: array

### cmyk()
Converts this color to Digital CMYK and returns its components (C, M, Y, K) as
an array of [ratios]($type/ratio). Note that this function will throw an error
when applied to an [rgb]($func/rgb) color, since its conversion to CMYK is not
available.

- returns: array

### luma()
If this color was created with [luma]($func/luma), returns the [integer]($type/integer)
value used on construction. Otherwise (for [rgb]($func/rgb) and [cmyk]($func/cmyk) colors),
throws an error.

- returns: integer

# Datetime
Represents a date, a time, or a combination of both. Can be created by either
specifying a custom datetime using the [`datetime`]($func/datetime) function or
getting the current date with [`datetime.today`]($func/datetime.today).

## Example
```example
#let date = datetime(
  year: 2020,
  month: 10,
  day: 4,
)

#date.display() \
#date.display(
  "y:[year repr:last_two]"
)

#let time = datetime(
  hour: 18,
  minute: 2,
  second: 23,
)

#time.display() \
#time.display(
  "h:[hour repr:12][period]"
)
```

## Format
You can specify a customized formatting using the
[`display`]($type/datetime.display) method. The format of a datetime is
specified by providing _components_ with a specified number of _modifiers_. A
component represents a certain part of the datetime that you want to display,
and with the help of modifiers you can define how you want to display that
component. In order to display a component, you wrap the name of the component
in square brackets (e.g. `[[year]]` will display the year). In order to add
modifiers, you add a space after the component name followed by the name of the
modifier, a colon and the value of the modifier (e.g. `[[month repr:short]]`
will display the short representation of the month).

The possible combination of components and their respective modifiers is as
follows:

* `year`: Displays the year of the datetime.
  * `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the year
    is padded.
  * `repr` Can be either `full` in which case the full year is displayed or
    `last_two` in which case only the last two digits are displayed.
  * `sign`: Can be either `automatic` or `mandatory`. Specifies when the sign
    should be displayed.
* `month`: Displays the month of the datetime.
  * `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the month
    is padded.
  * `repr`: Can be either `numerical`, `long` or `short`. Specifies if the month
    should be displayed as a number or a word. Unfortunately, when choosing the
    word representation, it can currently only display the English version. In
    the future, it is planned to support localization.
* `day`: Displays the day of the datetime.
  * `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the day
    is padded.
* `week_number`: Displays the week number of the datetime.
  * `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the week
    number is padded.
  * `repr`: Can be either `ISO`, `sunday` or `monday`. In the case of `ISO`,
    week numbers are between 1 and 53, while the other ones are between 0
    and 53.
* `weekday`: Displays the weekday of the date.
  * `repr` Can be either `long`, `short`, `sunday` or `monday`. In the case of
    `long` and `short`, the corresponding English name will be displayed (same
    as for the month, other languages are currently not supported). In the case
    of `sunday` and `monday`, the numerical value will be displayed (assuming
    Sunday and Monday as the first day of the week, respectively).
  * `one_indexed`: Can be either `true` or `false`. Defines whether the
    numerical representation of the week starts with 0 or 1.
* `hour`: Displays the hour of the date.
  * `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the hour
    is padded.
  * `repr`: Can be either `24` or `12`. Changes whether the hour is displayed in
    the 24-hour or 12-hour format.
* `period`: The AM/PM part of the hour
  * `case`: Can be `lower` to display it in lower case and `upper` to display it
    in upper case.
* `minute`: Displays the minute of the date.
  * `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the minute
    is padded.
* `second`: Displays the second of the date.
  * `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the second
    is padded.

Keep in mind that not always all components can be used. For example, if
you create a new datetime with `{datetime(year: 2023, month: 10, day: 13)}`, it
will be stored as a plain date internally, meaning that you cannot use
components such as `hour` or `minute`, which would only work on datetimes
that have a specified time.

## Methods
### display()
Displays the datetime in a certain way. Depending on whether you have defined
just a date, a time or both, the default format will be different.
If you specified a date, it will be `[[year]-[month]-[day]]`. If you specified a
time, it will be `[[hour]:[minute]:[second]]`. In the case of a datetime, it
will be `[[year]-[month]-[day] [hour]:[minute]:[second]]`.

Otherwise, it returns `{none}`.

- returns: integer or none

# Duration
Represents a span of time. Can be created by either specifying a custom
duration using the [`duration`]($func/datetime) function or by subtracting two
[datetimes]($type/datetime).

## Example
```example
#let duration = duration(
  days: 4,
  hours: 2,
  minutes: 10,
)

#duration.hours()
```

## Methods

# Symbol
A Unicode symbol.

Typst defines common symbols so that they can easily be written with standard
keyboards. The symbols are defined in modules, from which they can be accessed
using [field access notation]($scripting/#fields):

- General symbols are defined in the [`sym` module]($category/symbols/sym)
- Emoji are defined in the [`emoji` module]($category/symbols/emoji)

Moreover, you can define custom symbols with the [symbol]($func/symbol)
function.

```example
#sym.arrow.r \
#sym.gt.eq.not \
$gt.eq.not$ \
#emoji.face.halo
```

Many symbols have different variants, which can be selected by appending the
modifiers with dot notation. The order of the modifiers is not relevant. Visit
the documentation pages of the symbol modules and click on a symbol to see its
available variants.

```example
$arrow.l$ \
$arrow.r$ \
$arrow.t.quad$
```

# Bytes
A sequence of bytes.

This is conceptually similar to an array of [integers]($type/integer) between
`{0}` and `{255}`, but represented much more efficiently.

You can convert
- a [string]($type/string) or an [array]($type/array) of integers to bytes with
  the [`bytes`]($func/bytes) function
- bytes to a string with the [`str`]($func/str) function
- bytes to an array of integers with the [`array`]($func/array) function

When [reading]($func/read) data from a file, you can decide whether to load it
as a string or as raw bytes.

```example
#bytes((123, 160, 22, 0)) \
#bytes("Hello 😃")

#let data = read(
  "rhino.png",
  encoding: none,
)

// Magic bytes.
#array(data.slice(0, 4)) \
#str(data.slice(1, 4))
```

## Methods
### len()
The length in bytes.

- returns: integer

### at()
Returns the byte at the specified index. Returns the default value if the index
is out of bounds or fails with an error if no default value was specified.

- index: integer (positional, required)
  The index at which to retrieve the byte.
- default: any (named)
  A default value to return if the index is out of bounds.
- returns: integer or any

### slice()
Extract a subslice of the bytes.
Fails with an error if the start or index is out of bounds.

- start: integer (positional, required)
  The start index (inclusive).
- end: integer (positional)
  The end index (exclusive). If omitted, the whole slice until the end is
  extracted.
- count: integer (named)
  The number of bytes to extract. This is equivalent to passing
  `start + count` as the `end` position. Mutually exclusive with `end`.
- returns: bytes

# String
A sequence of Unicode codepoints.

You can iterate over the grapheme clusters of the string using a
[for loop]($scripting/#loops). Grapheme clusters are basically characters but
keep together things that belong together, e.g. multiple codepoints that
together form a flag emoji. Strings can be added with the `+` operator,
[joined together]($scripting/#blocks) and multiplied with integers.

Typst provides utility methods for string manipulation. Many of these methods
(e.g., `split`, `trim` and `replace`) operate on _patterns:_ A pattern can be
either a string or a [regular expression]($func/regex). This makes the methods
quite versatile.

All lengths and indices are expressed in terms of UTF-8 characters. Indices are
zero-based and negative indices wrap around to the end of the string.

You can convert a value to a string with the [`str`]($func/str) function.

### Example
```example
#"hello world!" \
#"\"hello\n  world\"!" \
#"1 2 3".split() \
#"1,2;3".split(regex("[,;]")) \
#(regex("\d+") in "ten euros") \
#(regex("\d+") in "10 euros")
```

### Escape sequences
Just like in markup, you can escape a few symbols in strings:
- `[\\]` for a backslash
- `[\"]` for a quote
- `[\n]` for a newline
- `[\r]` for a carriage return
- `[\t]` for a tab
- `[\u{1f600}]` for a hexadecimal Unicode escape sequence

## Methods

Fails with an error if the string is empty.

- returns: any

### at()
Extract the first grapheme cluster after the specified index. Returns the
default value if the index is out of bounds or fails with an error if no default
value was specified.

- index: integer (positional, required)
  The byte index.

  The pattern to search for.
- returns: integer or none

### match()
Searches for the specified pattern in the string and returns a dictionary
with details about the first match or `{none}` if there is no match.

The returned dictionary has the following keys:
* `start`: The start offset of the match
* `end`: The end offset of the match
* `text`: The text that matched.
* `captures`: An array containing a string for each matched capturing group. The
  first item of the array contains the first matched capturing, not the whole
  match! This is empty unless the `pattern` was a regex with capturing groups.

- pattern: string or regex (positional, required)
  The pattern to search for.

the resulting parts.

- pattern: string or regex (positional)
  The pattern to split at. Defaults to whitespace.
- returns: array

# Content
A piece of document content.

This type is at the heart of Typst. All markup you write and most
[functions]($type/function) you call produce content values. You can create a
content value by enclosing markup in square brackets. This is also how you pass
content to functions.

```example
Type of *Hello!* is
#type([*Hello!*])
```

Content can be added with the `+` operator,
[joined together]($scripting/#blocks) and multiplied with
integers. Wherever content is expected, you can also pass a
[string]($type/string) or `{none}`.

## Representation
Content consists of elements with fields. When constructing an element with
its _element function,_ you provide these fields as arguments and when you have
a content value, you can access its fields with
[field access syntax]($scripting/#field-access).

Some fields are required: These must be provided when constructing an element
and as a consequence, they are always available through field access on content
of that type. Required fields are marked as such in the documentation.

Most fields are optional: Like required fields, they can be passed to the
element function to configure them for a single element. However, these can also
be configured with [set rules]($styling/#set-rules) to apply them to all
elements within a scope. Optional fields are only available with field access
syntax when they are were explicitly passed to the element function, not when
they result from a set rule.

Each element has a default appearance. However, you can also completely
customize its appearance with a [show rule]($styling/#show-rules). The show rule
is passed the element. It can access the element's field and produce arbitrary
content from it.

In the web app, you can hover over a content variable to see exactly which
elements the content is composed of and what fields they have. Alternatively,
you can inspect the output of the [`repr`]($func/repr) function.

## Methods
### func()
The content's element function. This function can be used to create the element
contained in this content. It can be used in set and show rules for the element.
Can be compared with global functions to check whether you have a specific
kind of element.

- returns: function

### has()
Whether the content has the specified field.

- field: string (positional, required)
  The field to look for.
- returns: boolean

### at()
Access the specified field on the content. Returns the default value if the
field does not exist or fails with an error if no default value was specified.

- field: string (positional, required)
  The field to access.
- default: any (named)
  A default value to return if the field does not exist.
- returns: any

### fields()
Return the fields of this content.

```example
#rect(
  width: 10cm,
  height: 10cm,
).fields()
```

- returns: dictionary

### location()
The location of the content. This is only available on content returned by
[query]($func/query), for other content it will fail with an error. The
resulting location can be used with [counters]($func/counter),
[state]($func/state) and [queries]($func/query).

- returns: location

# Array
A sequence of values.

You can construct an array by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of values
in parentheses. The values do not have to be of the same type.

You can access and update array items with the `.at()` method. Indices are
zero-based and negative indices wrap around to the end of the array. You can
iterate over an array using a [for loop]($scripting/#loops).
Arrays can be added together with the `+` operator,
[joined together]($scripting/#blocks) and multiplied with
integers.

**Note:** An array of length one needs a trailing comma, as in `{(1,)}`. This is
to disambiguate from a simple parenthesized expressions like `{(1 + 2) * 3}`.
An empty array is written as `{()}`.

## Example
```example
#let values = (1, 7, 4, -3, 2)

#values.at(0) \
#(values.at(0) = 3)
#values.at(-1) \
#values.find(calc.even) \
#values.filter(calc.odd) \
#values.map(calc.abs) \
#values.rev() \
#(1, (2, 3)).flatten() \
#(("A", "B", "C")
    .join(", ", last: " and "))
```

## Methods
### len()
The number of values in the array.

- returns: integer

### first()
Returns the first item in the array.
May be used on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Fails with an error if the array is empty.

- returns: any

### last()
Returns the last item in the array.
May be used on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Fails with an error if the array is empty.

- returns: any

### at()

- end: integer (positional)
  The end index (exclusive). If omitted, the whole slice until the end of the
  array is extracted.

  `start + count` as the `end` position. Mutually exclusive with `end`.
- returns: array

### contains()

### zip()
Zips the array with other arrays. If the arrays are of unequal length, it will
only zip up until the last element of the shortest array and the remaining
elements will be ignored. The return value is an array where each element is
yet another array, the size of each of those is the number of zipped arrays.

This method is variadic, meaning that you can zip multiple arrays together at
once: `(1, 2, 3).zip((3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8))` returning:

# Dictionary
A map from string keys to values.

You can construct a dictionary by enclosing comma-separated `key: value` pairs
in parentheses. The values do not have to be of the same type. Since empty
parentheses already yield an empty array, you have to use the special `(:)`
syntax to create an empty dictionary.

A dictionary is conceptually similar to an array, but it is indexed by strings
instead of integers. You can access and create dictionary entries with the
`.at()` method. If you know the key statically, you can alternatively use
[field access notation]($scripting/#fields) (`.key`) to access
the value. Dictionaries can be added with the `+` operator and
[joined together]($scripting/#blocks).
To check whether a key is present in the dictionary, use the `in` keyword.

You can iterate over the pairs in a dictionary using a
[for loop]($scripting/#loops). This will iterate in the order the pairs were
inserted / declared.

## Example
```example
#let dict = (
  name: "Typst",
  born: 2019,
)

#dict.name \
#(dict.launch = 20)
#dict.len() \
#dict.keys() \
#dict.values() \
#dict.at("born") \
#dict.insert("city", "Berlin ")
#("name" in dict)
```

## Methods
### len()
The number of pairs in the dictionary.

- returns: integer

### at()
Returns the value associated with the specified key in the dictionary. May be
used on the left-hand side of an assignment if the key is already present in the
dictionary. Returns the default value if the key is not part of the dictionary
or fails with an error if no default value was specified.

- key: string (positional, required)
  The key at which to retrieve the item.
- default: any (named)
  A default value to return if the key is not part of the dictionary.
- returns: any

### insert()
Insert a new pair into the dictionary and return the value.
If the dictionary already contains this key, the value is updated.

- key: string (positional, required)
  The key of the pair that should be inserted.
- value: any (positional, required)
  The value of the pair that should be inserted.

### keys()
Returns the keys of the dictionary as an array in insertion order.

- returns: array

### values()
Returns the values of the dictionary as an array in insertion order.

- returns: array

### pairs()
Returns the keys and values of the dictionary as an array of pairs. Each pair is
represented as an array of length two.

- returns: array

### remove()
Remove a pair from the dictionary by key and return the value.

- key: string (positional, required)
  The key of the pair that should be removed.
- returns: any

# Function
A mapping from argument values to a return value.

You can call a function by writing a comma-separated list of function
_arguments_ enclosed in parentheses directly after the function name.
Additionally, you can pass any number of trailing content blocks arguments to a
function _after_ the normal argument list. If the normal argument list would
become empty, it can be omitted. Typst supports positional and named arguments.
The former are identified by position and type, while the later are written as
`name: value`.

Within math mode, function calls have special behaviour. See the
[math documentation]($category/math) for more details.

### Example
```example
// Call a function.
#list([A], [B])

// Named arguments and trailing
// content blocks.
#enum(start: 2)[A][B]

// Version without parentheses.
#list[A][B]
```

Functions are a fundamental building block of Typst. Typst provides functions
for a variety of typesetting tasks. Moreover, the markup you write is backed by
functions and all styling happens through functions. This reference lists all
available functions and how you can use them. Please also refer to the
documentation about [set]($styling/#set-rules) and
[show]($styling/#show-rules) rules to learn about additional ways
you can work with functions in Typst.

### Element functions { #element-functions }
Some functions are associated with _elements_ like [headings]($func/heading) or
[tables]($func/table). When called, these create an element of their respective
kind. In contrast to normal functions, they can further be used in
[set rules]($styling/#set-rules), [show rules]($styling/#show-rules), and
[selectors]($type/selector).

### Function scopes { #function-scopes }
Functions can hold related definitions in their own scope, similar to a
[module]($scripting/#modules). Examples of this are
[`assert.eq`]($func/assert.eq) or [`list.item`]($func/list.item). However, this
feature is currently only available for built-in functions.

### Defining functions { #definitions }
You can define your own function with a
[let binding]($scripting/#bindings) that has a parameter list after
the binding's name. The parameter list can contain positional parameters,
named parameters with default values and
[argument sinks]($type/arguments).
The right-hand side of the binding can be a block or any other expression. It
defines the function's return value and can depend on the parameters.

```example
#let alert(body, fill: red) = {
  set text(white)
  set align(center)
  rect(
    fill: fill,
    inset: 8pt,
    radius: 4pt,
    [*Warning:\ #body*],
  )
}

#alert[
  Danger is imminent!
]

#alert(fill: blue)[
  KEEP OFF TRACKS
]
```

### Unnamed functions { #unnamed }
You can also created an unnamed function without creating a binding by
specifying a parameter list followed by `=>` and the function body. If your
function has just one parameter, the parentheses around the parameter list are
optional. Unnamed functions are mainly useful for show rules, but also for
settable properties that take functions like the page function's
[`footer`]($func/page.footer) property.

```example
#show "once?": it => [#it #it]
once?
```

### Notable fact
In Typst, all functions are _pure._ This means that for the same
arguments, they always return the same result. They cannot "remember" things to
produce another value when they are called a second time.

The only exception are built-in methods like
[`array.push(value)`]($type/array.push). These can modify the values they are
called on.

## Methods
### with()
Returns a new function that has the given arguments pre-applied.

- arguments: any (variadic)
  The named and positional arguments to apply.
- returns: function

### where()
Returns a selector that filters for elements belonging to this function
whose fields have the values of the given arguments.

- fields: any (named, variadic)
  The field values to filter by.
- returns: selector

# Arguments
Captured arguments to a function.

## Argument Sinks
Like built-in functions, custom functions can also take a variable number of
arguments. You can specify an _argument sink_ which collects all excess
arguments as `..sink`. The resulting `sink` value is of the `arguments` type. It
exposes methods to access the positional and named arguments.

```example
#let format(title, ..authors) = {
  let by = authors
    .pos()
    .join(", ", last: " and ")

  [*#title* \ _Written by #by;_]
}

#format("ArtosFlow", "Jane", "Joe")
```

## Spreading
Inversely to an argument sink, you can _spread_ arguments, arrays and
dictionaries into a function call with the `..spread` operator:

```example
#let array = (2, 3, 5)
#calc.min(..array)

#let dict = (fill: blue)
#text(..dict)[Hello]
```

## Methods
### pos()
Returns the captured positional arguments as an array.

- returns: array

### named()
Returns the captured named arguments as a dictionary.

- returns: dictionary

# Selector
A filter for selecting elements within the document.

You can construct a selector in the following ways:
- you can use an element [function]($type/function)
- you can filter for an element function with
  [specific fields]($type/function.where)
- you can use a [string]($type/string) or [regular expression]($func/regex)
- you can use a [`{<label>}`]($func/label)
- you can use a [`location`]($func/locate)
- call the [`selector`]($func/selector) function to convert any of the above
  types into a selector value and use the methods below to refine it

Selectors are used to [apply styling rules]($styling/#show-rules) to elements.
You can also use selectors to [query]($func/query) the document for certain
types of elements.

Furthermore, you can pass a selector to several of Typst's built-in functions to
configure their behaviour. One such example is the [outline]($func/outline)
where it can be used to change which elements are listed within the outline.

Multiple selectors can be combined using the methods shown below. However, not
all kinds of selectors are supported in all places, at the moment.

## Example
```example
#locate(loc => query(
  heading.where(level: 1)
    .or(heading.where(level: 2)),
  loc,
))

= This will be found
== So will this
=== But this will not.
```

## Methods
### or()
Allows combining any of a series of selectors. This is used to
select multiple components or components with different properties
all at once.

- other: selector (variadic, required)
  The list of selectors to match on.

### and()
Allows combining all of a series of selectors. This is used to check
whether a component meets multiple selection rules simultaneously.

- other: selector (variadic, required)
  The list of selectors to match on.

### before()
Returns a modified selector that will only match elements that occur before the
first match of the selector argument.

- end: selector (positional, required)
  The original selection will end at the first match of `end`.
- inclusive: boolean (named)
  Whether `end` itself should match or not. This is only relevant if both
  selectors match the same type of element. Defaults to `{true}`.

### after()
Returns a modified selector that will only match elements that occur after the
first match of the selector argument.

- start: selector (positional, required)
  The original selection will start at the first match of `start`.
- inclusive: boolean (named)
  Whether `start` itself should match or not. This is only relevant if both
  selectors match the same type of element. Defaults to `{true}`.

# Module
An evaluated module, either built-in or resulting from a file.

You can access definitions from the module using
[field access notation]($scripting/#fields) and interact with it using the
[import and include syntaxes]($scripting/#modules).

## Example
```example
<<< #import "utils.typ"
<<< #utils.add(2, 5)

<<< #import utils: sub
<<< #sub(1, 4)
>>> #7
>>>
>>> #(-3)
```
