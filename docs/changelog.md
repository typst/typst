# Changelog
## Version 0.8.0 (September 13, 2023) { #v0.8.0 }
- Scripting
  - Plugins (thanks to [@astrale-sharp](https://github.com/astrale-sharp) and
    [@arnaudgolfouse](https://github.com/arnaudgolfouse))
    - Typst can now load [plugins]($plugin) that are compiled to WebAssembly
    - Anything that can be compiled to WebAssembly can thus be loaded as a
      plugin
    - These plugins are fully encapsulated (no access to file system or network)
    - Plugins can be shipped as part of [packages]($scripting/#packages)
    - Plugins work just the same in the web app
  - Types are now first-class values (**Breaking change**)
    - A [type]($type) is now itself a value
    - Some types can be called like functions (those that have a constructor),
      e.g. [`int`]($int) and [`str`]($str)
    - Type checks are now of the form `{type(10) == int}` instead of the old
      `{type(10) == "integer"}`. [Compatibility]($type/#compatibility) with the
      old way will remain for a while to give package authors time to upgrade,
      but it will be removed at some point.
    - Methods are now syntax sugar for calling a function scoped to a type,
      meaning that `{"hello".len()}` is equivalent to `{str.len("hello")}`
  - Added support for [`import`]($scripting/#modules) renaming with `as`
  - Added a [`duration`]($duration) type
  - Added support for [CBOR]($cbor) encoding and decoding
  - Added encoding and decoding functions from and to bytes for data formats:
    [`json.decode`]($json.decode), [`json.encode`]($json.encode), and similar
    functions for other formats
  - Added [`array.intersperse`]($array.intersperse) function
  - Added [`str.rev`]($str.rev) function
  - Added `calc.tau` constant
  - Made [bytes]($bytes) joinable and addable
  - Made [`array.zip`]($array.zip) function variadic
  - Fixed bug with [`eval`]($eval) when the `mode` was set to `{"math"}`
  - Fixed bug with [`ends-with`]($str.ends-with) function on strings
  - Fixed bug with destructuring in combination with break, continue, and return
  - Fixed argument types of [hyperbolic functions]($calc.cosh), they don't allow
    angles anymore (**Breaking change**)
  - Renamed some color methods: `rgba` becomes `to-rgba`, `cmyk` becomes
    `to-cmyk`, and `luma` becomes `to-luma` (**Breaking change**)

- Export
  - Added SVG export
    (thanks to [@Enter-tainer](https://github.com/Enter-tainer))
  - Fixed bugs with PDF font embedding
  - Added support for page labels that reflect the
    [page numbering]($page.numbering) style in the PDF

- Text and Layout
  - Added [`highlight`]($highlight) function for highlighting text with a
    background color
  - Added [`polygon.regular`]($polygon.regular) function for drawing a regular
    polygon
  - Added support for tabs in [`raw`]($raw) elements alongside
    [`tab-width`]($raw.tab-size) parameter
  - The layout engine now tries to prevent "runts" (final lines consisting of
    just a single word)
  - Added Finnish translations
  - Added hyphenation support for Polish
  - Improved handling of consecutive smart quotes of different kinds
  - Fixed vertical alignments for [`number-align`]($page.number-align) argument
    on page function (**Breaking change**)

  - Fixed sizing of block containing just a single box

- Math
  - Added support for [augmented matrices]($math.mat.augment)
  - Removed support for automatic matching of fences like `|` and `||` as
    there were too many false positives. You can use functions like
    [`abs`]($math.abs) or [`norm`]($math.norm) or an explicit [`lr`]($math.lr)
    call instead. (**Breaking change**)
  - Fixed spacing after number with decimal point in math
  - Fixed bug with primes in subscript
  - Fixed weak spacing
  - Fixed crash when text within math contains a newline

- Tooling and Diagnostics
  - Added hints when trying to call a function stored in a dictionary without
    extra parentheses
  - Fixed hint when referencing an equation without numbering
  - Added more details to some diagnostics (e.g. when SVG decoding fails)

- Command line interface

    (thanks to [@jimvdl](https://github.com/jimvdl))

  - The CLI now respects proxy configuration through environment variables and
    has a new `--cert` option for setting a custom CA certificate

- Miscellaneous Improvements
  - Added [page setup guide]($guides/page-setup-guide)
  - Added [`figure.caption`]($figure.caption) function that can be used for
    simpler figure customization (**Breaking change** because `it.caption` now
    renders the full caption with supplement in figure show rules and manual
    outlines)
  - Moved `caption-pos` argument to `figure.caption` function and renamed it to
    `position` (**Breaking change**)
  - Added [`separator`]($figure.caption.separator) argument to `figure.caption`
    function
  - Added support for combination of and/or and before/after
    [selectors]($selector)
  - Packages can now specify a
    [minimum compiler version](https://github.com/typst/packages#package-format)
    they require to work
  - Fixed parser bug where method calls could be moved onto their own line for
    `[#let]` expressions in markup (**Breaking change**)
  - Fixed bugs in sentence and title case conversion for bibliographies
  - Fixed supplements for alphanumeric and author-title bibliography styles
  - Fixed off-by-one error in APA bibliography style

- Development
  - Made `Span` and `FileId` more type-safe so that all error conditions must be
    handled by `World` implementors

  - Fixed a parsing bug with dictionaries

- Development
  - Extracted parser and syntax tree into `typst-syntax` crate
