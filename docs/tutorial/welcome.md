# Tutorial
Welcome to Typst's tutorial! In this tutorial, you will learn how to write and
format documents in Typst. We will start with everyday tasks and gradually
introduce more advanced features. This tutorial does not assume prior knowledge
of Typst, other Markup languages, or programming. We do assume that you know how
to edit a text file.

The best way to start is to sign up to the Typst app for free and follow along
with the steps below. The app gives you instant preview, syntax highlighting and
helpful autocompletions. Alternatively, you can follow along in your local text
editor with the [open-source CLI](https://github.com/typst/typst).

## When to use Typst { #when-typst }
Before we get started, let's check what Typst is and when to use it. Typst is a
markup language for typesetting documents. It is designed to be easy to learn,
fast, and versatile. Typst takes text files with markup in them and outputs
PDFs.

Typst is a good choice for writing any long form text such as essays, articles,
scientific papers, books, reports, and homework assignments. Moreover, Typst is
a great fit for any documents containing mathematical notation, such as papers
in the math, physics, and engineering fields. Finally, due to its strong styling
and automation features, it is an excellent choice for any set of documents that
share a common style, such as a book series.
