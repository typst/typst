# Overview
Welcome to Typst's documentation! Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system
for the sciences. It is designed to be an alternative both to advanced tools
like LaTeX and simpler tools like Word and Google Docs. Our goal with Typst is
to build a typesetting tool that is highly capable _and_ a pleasure to use.

This documentation is split into two parts: a beginner-friendly tutorial that
introduces Typst through a practical use case and a comprehensive reference that
explains all of Typst's concepts and features.

We also invite you to join the community we're building around Typst. Typst is
still a very young project, so your feedback is more than valuable.
