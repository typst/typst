# Version 0.13.0

## Highlights
- There is now a distinction between [proper paragraphs]($par) and just
  inline-level content. This is important for future work on accessibility and
  means that [first line indent]($par.first-line-indent) can now be enabled for
  all paragraphs instead of just consecutive ones.
- The [`outline`] has a better out-of-the-box look and is more customizable
- The new [`curve`] function (that supersedes the `path` function) provides a
  simpler and more flexible interface for creating Bézier curves
- The `image` function now supports raw [pixel raster formats]($image.format)
  for generating images from within Typst
- Functions that accept [file paths]($syntax/#paths) now also accept raw
  [bytes] instead, for full flexibility
- WebAssembly [plugins]($plugin) are more flexible and automatically run
  multi-threaded
- Fixed a long-standing bug where single-letter strings in math (`[$"a"$]`)
  would be displayed in italics
- You can now specify which charset should be [covered]($text.font) by which
  font family
- The [`pdf.embed`] function lets you embed arbitrary files in the exported
  PDF
- HTML export is currently under active development. The feature is still _very_
  incomplete, but already available for experimentation behind a feature flag.

## Model
- There is now a distinction between [proper paragraphs]($par) and just
  inline-level content **(Breaking change)**
  - All text at the root of a document is wrapped in paragraphs. Meanwhile, text
    in a container (like a block) is only wrapped in a paragraph if the
    container holds any block-level content. If all of the content is
    inline-level, no paragraph is created.
  - In the laid-out document, it's not immediately visible whether text became
    part of a paragraph. However, it is still important for accessibility, HTML
    export, and for properties like `first-line-indent`.
  - Show rules on `par` now only affect proper paragraphs
  - The `first-line-indent` and `hanging-indent` properties also only affect
    proper paragraphs
  - Creating a `{par[..]}` with body content that is not fully inline-level will
    result in a warning
  - The default show rules of various built-in elements like lists, quotes, etc.
    were adjusted to ensure they produce/don't produce paragraphs as appropriate
- The [`outline`] function was fully reworked to improve its out-of-the-box
  behavior **(Breaking change)**
  - [Outline entries]($outline.entry) are now [blocks]($block) and are thus
    affected by block spacing
  - The `{auto}` indentation mode now aligns numberings and titles outline-wide
    for a grid-like look
  - Automatic indentation now also indents entries without a numbering
  - Titles wrapping over multiple lines now have hanging indent
  - The page number won't appear alone on its own line anymore
  - The link now spans the full entry instead of just the title and page number
  - The default spacing between outline leader dots was increased
  - The [`fill`]($outline.entry.fill) parameter was moved from `outline` to
    `outline.entry` and can thus be configured through show-set rules
  - Removed `body` and `page` fields from outline entry
  - Added `indented`, `prefix`, `inner`, `body`, and `page` methods on outline
    entries to simplify writing of show rules
- Added configuration to [`par.first-line-indent`] for indenting all paragraphs
  instead of just consecutive ones
- Added [`form`]($ref.form) parameter to `ref` function. Setting the form to
  `{"page"}` will produce a page reference instead of a textual one.
- Added [`document.description`] field, which results in corresponding PDF and
  HTML metadata
- Added [`enum.reversed`] parameter
- Added support for Greek [numbering]
- When the [`link`] function wraps around a container like a [block], it will
  now generate only one link for the whole block instead of individual links for
  all the visible leaf elements. This significantly reduces PDF file sizes when
  combining `link` and [`repeat`].
- The [`link`] function will now only strip one prefix (like `mailto:` or
  `tel:`) instead of multiple
- The link function now suppresses hyphenation via a built-in show-set rule
  rather than through its default show rule
- Displaying the page counter without a specified numbering will now take the
  page numbering into account

## Visualization
- Added new [`curve`] function that supersedes the [`path`] function and
  provides a simpler and more flexible interface. The `path` function is now
  deprecated.
- The `image` function now supports raw [pixel raster formats]($image.format).
  This can be used to generate images from within Typst without the need for
  encoding in an image exchange format.
- Added [`image.scaling`] parameter for configuring how an image is scaled by
  PNG export and PDF viewers (smooth or pixelated)
- Added [`image.icc`] parameter for providing or overriding the ICC profile of
  an image
- Renamed `pattern` to [`tiling`]. The name `pattern` remains as a deprecated
  alias.
- Added [`gradient.center`], [`gradient.radius`], [`gradient.focal-center`], and
  [`gradient.focal-radius`] methods
- Fixed interaction of clipping and outset on [`box`] and [`block`]
- Fixed panic with [`path`] of infinite length
- Fixed non-solid (e.g. tiling) text fills in clipped blocks
- Auto-detection of image formats from a raw buffer now has basic support for
  SVGs

## Scripting
- Functions that accept [file paths]($syntax/#paths) now also accept raw
  [bytes]
  - [`image`], [`cbor`], [`csv`], [`json`], [`toml`], [`xml`], and [`yaml`] now
    support a path string or bytes and their `.decode` variants are deprecated
  - [`plugin`], [`bibliography`], [`bibliography.style`], [`cite.style`],
    [`raw.theme`], and [`raw.syntaxes`] now accept bytes in addition to path
    strings. These did not have `.decode` variants, so this adds new
    flexibility.
  - The `path` argument/field of [`image`] and [`bibliography`] was renamed to
    `source` and `sources`, respectively **(Minor breaking change)**
- Improved WebAssembly [plugins]($plugin)
  - The `plugin` type is replaced by a [`plugin` function]($plugin) that returns
    a [module] containing normal Typst functions. This module can be used with
    import syntax. **(Breaking change)**
  - Plugins now automatically run in multiple threads without any changes by
    plugin authors
  - A new [`plugin.transition`] API is introduced which allows plugins to run
    impure initialization in a way that doesn't break Typst's purity guarantees
- The variable name bound by a bare import (no renaming, no import list) is now
  determined statically and dynamic imports without `{as}` renaming (e.g.
  `{import "ot" + "her.typ"}`) are a hard error **(Breaking change)**
- Values of the [`arguments`] type can now be added with `+` and
  [joined]($scripting/#blocks) in curly-braced code blocks
- Functions in an element function's scope can now be called with method syntax,
  bringing elements and types closer (in anticipation of a future full
  unification of the two). Currently, this is only useful for [`outline.entry`]
  as no other element function defines methods.
- Added [`calc.norm`] function
- Added support for 32-bit floats in [`float.from-bytes`] and [`float.to-bytes`]
- The [`decimal`] constructor now also accepts decimal values
- Improved `repr` of [symbols]($symbol), [arguments], and [types]($type)
- Duplicate [symbol] variants and modifiers are now a hard error
  **(Breaking change)**

## Math
- Fixed a bug where single letter strings in math (`[$"a"$]`) would be displayed
  in italics
- Math function calls can now have hyphenated named arguments and support
  [argument spreading]($arguments/#spreading)
- Better looking accents thanks to support for the `flac` (Flattened Accent
  Forms) and `dtls` (Dotless Forms) OpenType features
- Added `lcm` [text operator]($math.op)
- The [`bold`]($math.bold) function now works with ϝ and Ϝ
- The [`italic`]($math.italic) function now works with ħ
- Fixed a bug where the extent of a math equation was wrongly affected by
  internal metadata
- Fixed interaction of [`lr`]($math.lr) and [context] expressions
- Fixed weak spacing being unconditionally ignored in [`lr`]($math.lr)
- Fixed sub/superscripts sometimes being in the wrong position with
  [`lr`]($math.lr)
- Fixed multi-line annotations (e.g. overbrace) changing the math baseline
- Fixed merging of attachments when the base is a nested equation
- Fixed resolving of contextual (em-based) text sizes within math
- Fixed spacing around ⊥

## Bibliography
- Prose and author-only citations now use editor names if the author names are
  unavailable
- Some non-standard but widely used BibLaTeX `editortype`s like `producer`,
  `writer`, `scriptwriter`, and `none` (defined by widespread style
  `biblatex-chicago` to mean performers within `music` and `video` entries) are
  now recognized
- CSL styles can now render affixes around the bibliography
- For BibTeX entries with `eprinttype = {pubmed}`, the PubMed ID will now be
  correctly processed
- Whitespace handling for strings delimiting initialized names has been improved
- Uppercase spelling after apostrophes used as quotation marks is now possible
- Fixed bugs around the handling of CSL delimiting characters
- Fixed a problem with parsing multibyte characters in page ranges that could
  prevent Hayagriva from parsing some BibTeX page ranges
- Updated CSL APA style
- Updated CSL locales for Finnish, Swiss German, Austrian German, German, and
  Arabic

## Text
- Added support for specifying which charset should be [covered]($text.font) by
  which font family
- Added [`all`]($smallcaps.all) parameter to `smallcaps` function that also
  enables small capitals on uppercase letters
- Added basic i18n for Basque and Bulgarian
- [Justification]($par.justify) does not affect [raw] blocks anymore
- [CJK-Latin-spacing]($text.cjk-latin-spacing) does not affect [raw] text
  anymore
- Fixed wrong language codes being used for Greek and Ukrainian
- Fixed default quotes for Croatian
- Fixed crash in RTL text handling
- Added support for [`raw`] syntax highlighting for a few new languages: CFML,
  NSIS, and WGSL
- New font metadata exception for New Computer Modern Sans Math
- Updated bundled New Computer Modern fonts to version 7.0

## Layout
- Fixed various bugs with footnotes
  - Fixed footnotes getting lost when multiple footnotes were nested within
    another footnote
  - Fixed endless loops with empty and overlarge footnotes
  - Fixed crash with overlarge footnotes within a floating placement
- Fixed sizing of quadratic shapes ([`square`] and [`circle`])
- Fixed [`block.sticky`] not working properly at the top of a container
- Fixed crash due to consecutive weak spacing
- Fixed crash when a [block] or text have negative sizes
- Fixed unnecessary hyphenations occurring in rare scenarios due to a bad
  interaction between padding and paragraph optimization
- Fixed lone [citations]($cite) in [`align`] not becoming their own paragraph

## Syntax
- Top-level closing square brackets that do not have a matching opening square
  bracket are now a hard error **(Minor breaking change)**
- Adding a space between the identifier and the parentheses in a set rule is not
  allowed anymore **(Minor breaking change)**
- Numbers with a unit cannot have a base prefix anymore, e.g. `0b100000pt` is
  not allowed anymore. Previously, it was syntactically allowed but always
  resolved to a value of zero. **(Minor breaking change)**
- Using `is` as an identifier will now warn as it might become a keyword in the
  future
- Fixed minor whitespace handling bugs
  - in math mode argument lists
  - at the end of headings
  - between a term list's term and description
- Fixed parsing of empty single line raw blocks with 3+ backticks and a language
  tag
- Fixed minor bug with parentheses parsing in math
- Markup that can only appear at the start of the line (headings, lists) can now
  also appear at the start of a list item
- A shebang `#!` at the very start of a file is now ignored

## PDF export
- Added `pdf.embed` function for embedding arbitrary files in the exported PDF
- Added support for PDF/A-3b export

## HTML export
**Note:** HTML export is currently under active development. The feature is
still _very_ incomplete, but already available for experimentation behind a
feature flag.

- Added HTML output support for some (but not all) of the built-in elements
- Added [`html.elem`] function for outputting an arbitrary HTML element
- Added [`html.frame`] function for integrating content that requires layout
  into HTML (by embedding an SVG)
- Added [`target`] function which returns either `{"paged"}` or `{"html"}`
  depending on the export target

## Tooling and Diagnostics
- Autocompletion improvements
  - Added autocompletion for file paths
  - Smarter autocompletion of variables: Completing `{rect(fill: |)}` will now
    only show variables which contain a valid fill (either directly or nested,
    e.g. a dictionary containing a valid fill)
  - Different functions will now autocomplete with different brackets (round vs
    square) depending on which kind is more useful
