# Version 0.11.0 (March 15, 2024)

## Tables
- Tables are now _much_ more flexible, read the new
  [Table Guide]($guides/tables) to get started
- Added [`table.cell`] element for per-cell configuration
- Cells can now span multiple [columns]($table.cell.colspan) or
  [rows]($table.cell.rowspan)
- The [stroke]($table.cell.stroke) of individual cells can now be customized
- The [`align`]($table.align) and [`inset`]($table.inset) arguments of the table
  function now also take `{(x, y) => ..}` functions
- Added [`table.hline`] and [`table.vline`] for convenient line customization
- Added [`table.header`] element for table headers that repeat on every page
- Added [`table.footer`] element for table footers that repeat on every page
- All the new table functionality is also available for [grids]($grid)

## Templates
- You can now use template packages to get started with new projects. Click
  _Start from template_ on the web app's dashboard and choose your preferred
  template or run the `typst init <template>` command in the CLI. You can
  [browse the available templates here]($universe/search/?kind=templates).
- Switching templates after the fact has become easier. You can just import a
  styling function from a different template package.
- Package authors can now submit their own templates to the
  [package repository](https://github.com/typst/packages). Share a template
  for a paper, your institution, or an original work to help the community get
  a head start on their projects.
- Templates and packages are now organized by category and discipline. Filter
  packages by either taxonomy in the _Start from template_ wizard. If you are a
  package author, take a look at the new documentation for
  [categories](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/docs/CATEGORIES.md) and
  [disciplines](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/docs/DISCIPLINES.md).

## Context
- Added _context expressions:_ Read the chapter on [context] to get started
- With context, you can access settable properties, e.g. `{context text.lang}`
  to access the language set via `{set text(lang: "..")}`
- The following existing functions have been made contextual: [`query`],
  [`locate`], [`measure`], [`counter.display`], [`counter.at`],
  [`counter.final`], [`state.at`], and [`state.final`]
- Added contextual methods [`counter.get`] and [`state.get`] to retrieve the
  value of a counter or state in the current context
- Added contextual function [`here`] to retrieve the [location] of the current
  context
- The [`locate`] function now returns the location of a selector's unique match.
  Its old behavior has been replaced by context expressions and only remains
  temporarily available for compatibility.
- The [`counter.at`] and [`state.at`] methods are now more flexible: They
  directly accept any kind of [locatable]($location/#locatable) selector with a
  unique match (e.g. a label) instead of just locations
- When context is available, [`counter.display`] now directly returns the result
  of applying the numbering instead of yielding opaque content. It should not be
  used anymore without context. (Deprecation planned)
- The `state.display` function should not be used anymore, use [`state.get`]
  instead (Deprecation planned)
- The `location` argument of [`query`], [`counter.final`], and [`state.final`]
  should not be used anymore (Deprecation planned)
- The `styles` argument of the `measure` function should not be used anymore
  (Deprecation planned)
- The `style` function should not be used anymore, use context instead
  (Deprecation planned)
- The correct context is now also provided in various other places where it is
  available, e.g. in show rules, layout callbacks, and numbering functions in
  the outline

## Styling
- Fixed priority of multiple [show-set rules]($styling/#show-rules): They now
  apply in the same order as normal set rules would
- Show-set rules on the same element (e.g. `{show heading.where(level: 1): set
  heading(numbering: "1.")}`) now work properly
- Setting properties on an element within a transformational show rule (e.g.
  `{show heading: it => { set heading(..); it }}`) is **not** supported anymore
  (previously it also only worked sometimes); use show-set rules instead
  **(Breaking change)**
- Text show rules that match their own output now work properly (e.g.
  `` {show "cmd": `cmd`} ``)
- The elements passed to show rules and returned by queries now contain all
  fields of their respective element functions rather than just specific ones
- All settable properties can now be used in [where]($function.where) selectors
- [And]($selector.and) and [or]($selector.or) selectors can now be used with
  show rules
- Errors within show rules and context expressions are now ignored in all but
  the last introspection iteration, in line with the behavior of the old
  [`locate`]
- Fixed a bug where document set rules were allowed after content

## Layout
- Added `reflow` argument to [`rotate`]($rotate) and [`scale`]($scale) which
  lets them affect the layout
- Fixed a bug where [floating placement]($place.float) or
  [floating figures]($figure.placement) could end up out of order
- Fixed overlap of text and figure for full-page floating figures
- Fixed various cases where the [`hide`] function didn't hide its contents
  properly
- Fixed usage of [`h`] and [`v`] in [stacks]($stack)
- Invisible content like a counter update will no longer force a visible block
  for just itself
- Fixed a bug with horizontal spacing followed by invisible content (like a
  counter update) directly at the start of a paragraph

## Text
- Added [`stroke`]($text.stroke) property for text
- Added basic i18n for Serbian and Catalan

- Fixed Finnish translation of "Listing"
- Fixed Z-ordering of multiple text decorations (underlines, etc.)
- Fixed a bug due to which text [features]($text.features) could not be
  overridden in consecutive set rules

## Model
- Added [`depth`]($heading.depth) and [`offset`]($heading.offset) arguments to
  heading to increase or decrease the heading level for a bunch of content; the
  heading syntax now sets `depth` rather than `level` **(Breaking change)**
- List [markers]($list.marker) now cycle by default
- The [`quote`] function now more robustly selects the correct quotes based on
  language and nesting
- Fixed indent bugs related to the default show rule of [terms]

## Math
- Inline equations now automatically linebreak at appropriate places

  relative to their base

- [Primes]($math.primes) are now always attached as [scripts]($math.scripts) by
  default
- Exposed [`math.primes`] element which backs the `[$f'$]` syntax in math
- Math mode is not affected by [`strong`] and [`emph`] anymore
- Fixed [`attach`]($math.attach) under [fractions]($math.frac)
- Fixed that [`math.class`] did not affect smart limit placement
- Fixed weak spacing in [`lr`]($math.lr) groups
- Fixed layout of large operators for Cambria Math font
- Fixed math styling of Hebrew symbol codepoints

  instead of being collapsed into normal spaces **(Breaking change)**
- Korean text can now use emphasis syntax without adding spaces
  **(Breaking change)**
- The token [`context`] is now a keyword and cannot be used as an identifier
  anymore **(Breaking change)**
- Nested line comments aren't allowed anymore in block comments
  **(Breaking change)**

  the CLI
- Added minimal CLI to `typst-docs` crate for extracting the language and
  standard library documentation as JSON
- The `typst_pdf::export` function's `ident` argument switched from `Option` to
  `Smart`. It should only be set to `Smart::Custom` if you can provide a stable
  identifier (like the web app can). The CLI sets `Smart::Auto`.
