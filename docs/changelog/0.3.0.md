# Version 0.3.0 (April 26, 2023)

## Breaking changes
- Renamed a few symbols: What was previous `dot.op` is now just `dot` and the
  basic dot is `dot.basic`. The same applies to `ast` and `tilde`.
- Renamed `mod` to [`rem`]($calc.rem) to more accurately reflect the behavior.
  It will remain available as `mod` until the next update as a grace period.
- A lone underscore is not a valid identifier anymore, it can now only be used
  in patterns
- Removed `before` and `after` arguments from [`query`]. This is now handled
  through flexible [selectors]($selector) combinator methods
- Added support for [attachments]($math.attach) (sub-, superscripts) that
  precede the base symbol. The `top` and `bottom` arguments have been renamed to
  `t` and `b`.

## New features
- Added support for more complex [strokes]($stroke) (configurable caps, joins,
  and dash patterns)
- Added [`cancel`]($math.cancel) function for equations
- Added support for [destructuring]($scripting/#bindings) in argument lists and
  assignments
- Added [`alt`]($image.alt) text argument to image function
- Added [`toml`] function for loading data from a TOML file
- Added [`zip`]($array.zip), [`sum`]($array.sum), and
  [`product`]($array.product) methods for arrays
- Added `fact`, `perm`, `binom`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `atan2`, `quo`, `trunc`, and
  `fract` [calculation]($category/foundations/calc) functions

## Improvements
- Text in SVGs now displays properly
- Typst now generates a PDF heading outline
- [References]($ref) now provides the referenced element as a field in show
  rules
- Refined linebreak algorithm for better Chinese justification
- Locations are now a valid kind of selector
- Added a few symbols for algebra
- Added Spanish smart quote support
- Added [`selector`] function to turn a selector-like value into a selector on
  which combinator methods can be called
- Improved some error messages
- The outline and bibliography headings can now be styled with show-set rules
- Operations on numbers now produce an error instead of overflowing

## Bug fixes
- Fixed wrong linebreak before punctuation that follows inline equations,
  citations, and other elements
- Fixed a bug with [argument sinks]($arguments)
- Fixed strokes with thickness zero
- Fixed hiding and show rules in math
- Fixed alignment in matrices
- Fixed some alignment bugs in equations
- Fixed grid cell alignment
- Fixed alignment of list marker and enum markers in presence of global
  alignment settings
- Fixed path closing

- A single trailing line breaks is now ignored in math, just like in text

## Command line interface
- Font path and compilation root can now be set with the environment variables
  `TYPST_FONT_PATHS` and `TYPST_ROOT`
- The output of `typst fonts` now includes the embedded fonts

## Development
- Added instrumentation for debugging and optimization
- Added `--update` flag and `UPDATE_EXPECT` environment variable to update
  reference images for tests
- You can now run a specific subtest with `--subtest`
- Tests now run on multiple threads
