## PDF export
PDF export was fully rewritten to use the new [`krilla`](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla) library, fixing various bugs and enabling many improvements. Known fixes are listed below, but there will likely be other changes in how the output behaves. If you spot any regressions, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues). _(Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV) for creating krilla!)_ [#5420]

- Typst now produces _accessible_ PDFs out of the box. Such documents are suitable for consumption in a wide range of circumstances. That not only includes consumption by people with permanent or temporary disabilities, but also by those with different devices or preferences.
  - Typst PDFs are now _tagged_ by default. _Tags_ are rich metadata that PDF viewers can use to make the document consumable in other ways than visually (e.g., through a screen reader).
  - In addition, Typst can now emit documents conforming to the PDF/UA-1 standard. (PDF/UA-2 is not yet supported, but planned.)
  - There is an increasing amount of existing and upcoming legislation requiring documents to be accessible, for instance, the European Accessibility Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
  - For more details on all of this, read the new [Accessibility Guide]($guides/accessibility).
- Typst now supports all PDF/A standards: PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-2u, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-3b, PDF/A-3u, PDF/A-3a, PDF/A-4, PDF/A-4f, and PDF/A-4e. See the [expanded PDF/A documentation]($pdf/#pdf-a) for guidance on how to select a suitable standard. [#5420] [#7038]
- Typst now supports the PDF versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 2.0 in addition to PDF 1.7. See the [relevant section of the PDF documentation]($pdf/#pdf-versions) for details. [#5420]
- Added [`pdf.artifact`] function for marking content as not semantically meaningful [#6619]
- Added experimental [`pdf.header-cell`], [`pdf.data-cell`], and [`pdf.table-summary`] functions for enhancing accessibility of documents with complex tables. These functions are guarded by the `a11y-extras` feature. They do not have a final interface and will be removed in the future, either through integration into table functions or through full removal. [#6619]
- PDF heading bookmarks now contain the heading's numbering [#6622]
- [Attachments]($pdf.attach)
  - Renamed `pdf.embed` to [`pdf.attach`] (the old name will remain as a deprecated alias until Typst 0.15) [#6705]
  - The [`mime`]($pdf.attach.mime-type) property of `pdf.attach` is now checked for syntactical correctness **(Minor breaking change)**
  - Fixed parsing of the [`data`]($pdf.attach.data) argument of `pdf.attach` [#6435]
  - Attachments now smartly determine whether they should be compressed [#6256]
- Text extraction (i.e. copy paste)
  - Now works correctly even when multiple different characters result in the same glyph [#5420]
  - Spaces between words at which a natural line break occurred are now correctly retained for text extraction [#6866]
  - Fixed mapping of hyphenation artifacts to Unicode text [#6799]
- Images
  - CMYK images now work properly in PDF export [#5420]
  - Improved export of text in SVG images with a filter [#5420]
  - Improved compatibility of SVG images with Quartz rendering engine (the engine used in Apple Preview) [#5420]
  - Improved handling of SVG images with high group nesting depth [#5420]
- Fixed a bug with text in patterns [#5420]
- Fixed gradients with transparency [#5420]

## HTML export
- Added support for many more built-in elements (the [_Model_ category]($category/model) is now fully covered)
  - The [`image`] element [#6578]
  - The [`footnote`] and [`footnote.entry`] element [#6917]
  - The [`outline`] and [`outline.entry`] element [#6606]
  - The [`bibliography`] element [#6952]
  - The [`smartquote`] element [#6710]
  - The [`sub`] and [`super`] elements [#6422]
  - The [`underline`], [`overline`], [`strike`], and [`highlight`] elements [#6510]
  - The [`smallcaps`] element [#6600]
  - The [`lower`] and [`upper`] functions [#6585]
- Added typed HTML API (e.g. [`html.div`]) with individually typed attributes [#6476]
  - For example, to generate a `video` element you can now write `[#html.video(width: 400, src: "sunrise.mp4")]` instead of `[#html.elem("video", attrs: (width: "400", src: "sunrise.mp4"))]`. Note how the `width` attribute takes an integer instead of a string.
- Added support for intra-doc [`link`] targets [#6602]
- The [`raw`] element
  - Added syntax highlighting support [#6691]
  - Block-level `raw` elements now emit both a `<code>` and a `<pre>` tag [#6701]
  - The [language tag]($raw.lang) of `raw` elements is now preserved as a `data-lang` attribute on the `<code>` tag [#6702]
- The [`authors`]($document.author) and [`keywords`]($document.keywords) properties of the `document` function now yield corresponding HTML `<meta>` tags [#6134]
- The [`html.elem`] function now supports custom HTML element names [#6676]
- Improved encoding of [`html.frame`] [#6605]
- Empty attributes are now encoded with shorthand syntax (e.g. `<div hidden></div>`) [#6479]
- Zero-sized horizontal weak spacing (`{h(0pt, weak: true)}`) does not cause a "was ignored during HTML export" warning anymore, so it can be used to destruct surrounding spaces without producing any output, as in paged export [#6917]
- Fixed encoding of `<pre>` and `<textarea>` elements that start with a newline [#6487] [#6497]
- Fixed encoding of [raw text elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#raw-text-elements) [#6487] [#6720]

- Reduced amount of `<g>` grouping elements that are generated [#6247]

## PNG export
- Fixed crash when [text size]($text.size) is negative [#5940]

## Visualize
- Added support for using PDFs as [images]($image) using the new [`hayro`](https://github.com/LaurenzV/hayro) library. PDFs will be embedded directly in PDF export, rasterized in PNG export, and turned into SVGs in SVG and HTML export. _(Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV) for creating hayro!)_ [#6623]
- Added support for WebP images [#6311]
- Various minor improvements for SVG images (see the [resvg 0.44 and 0.45 changelogs](https://github.com/linebender/resvg/blob/v0.45.1/CHANGELOG.md#0450---2025-02-26))

- Fixed stroke cap handling of shapes with partial strokes [#5688]
- Fixed corner radius handling of shapes with partial strokes [#6976]
- Fixed crash when sampling across two coinciding gradient stops [#6166]

## Layout
- Added opt-in support for character-level justification in addition to word-level justification, configured via the new [`par.justification-limits`] property. This is an impactful microtypographical technique that can significantly improve the appearance of justified text. [#6161]
- Fixed wrong linebreak opportunities related to object replacement characters [#6251]
- Fixed an issue where a breakable block would still produce an empty segment even if nothing fit into the first segment, leading to various undesirable behaviors in combination with fills, strokes, and [stickiness]($block.sticky) [#6335]
- Fixed crash with set rule for column or rowspan on a grid cell [#6401]
- Fixed [CJK-Latin-spacing]($text.cjk-latin-spacing) at manual line breaks [#6700] and at sub- and superscript boundaries [#7175]

  - Glyph layout in math now uses proper text shaping, leading to better handling of more complex Unicode features [#6336]
  - Generated characters in an equation (e.g. the `âˆš` produced by `sqrt`) can now be targeted by text show rules [#6365]
  - Added [`scr`]($math.scr) function for roundhand script font style [#6309]
  - Added `dotless` parameter to [`accent`]($math.accent) (typically for rendering a dotless accented i or j) [#5939]
  - Script-style glyphs are now preferred at reduced math sizes [#6320]
  - Fixed [`text.stroke`] in math [#6243]
  - Broken glyph assemblies are now prevented even when font data is incorrect [#6688]
- Layout
  - Fixed a bug with vertical accent positioning [#5941]
  - Fixed positioning of bottom accents [#6187]
  - Fixed a bug with layout of roots [#6021]
  - Improved layout of [`vec`]($math.vec) and [`cases`]($math.cases), making it consistent with [`mat`]($math.mat) [#5934]
  - Removed linebreak opportunity before closing bracket in inline math [#6216]
- An [`augment`]($math.mat.augment) line can now exist at the start and end of a matrix, not only in between columns and rows [#5806]
- Shorthands and multi-character numbers do not bind more tightly than fractions anymore in cases like `[$x>=(y)/z$]` [#5925] [#5996] **(Minor breaking change)**
- Named arguments passed to symbols used as function now raise an error instead of being silently ignored [#6192] **(Minor breaking change)**
- The [`mid`]($math.mid) element does not force the [`{"large"}` math class]($math.class) upon its contents anymore and instead defaults to `{"relation"}` [#5980]
- Fixed error in math parsing when `..` isn't followed by anything [#7105]
- Fixed the default math class of â…‹, âŽ°, âŸ…, âŽ±, âŸ†, âŸ‡, and ØŒ [#5949] [#6537]

_Thanks to [@mkorje](https://github.com/mkorje) for his work on math!_

## Model
- Tables
  - Added support for multiple [headers]($table.header) and subheaders in tables [#6168]
  - Table headers now force a rowbreak, i.e. an incomplete row before a header will not be filled with cells after the header [#6687]
  - Fixed a bug where [headers]($table.header) and footers could accidentally expand to contain non-header cells [#5919]
- Added [`title`] element for displaying the document title [#5618]
- Added [`figure.alt`] property for setting an alternative description for a figure [#6619]
- [Link]($link) hit boxes for text are now vertically a bit larger to avoid issues with automatic link detection in PDF viewers [#6252]
- The [`link`] function will now produce an error when passed an empty string as a URL [#7049] **(Minor breaking change)**
- The value of the [`number`]($enum.item.number) argument of `enum.item` now takes `{auto}` instead of `{none}` for automatic numbering [#6609] **(Minor breaking change)**
- Improved spacing of nested tight lists [#6242]
- Fixed that `{quotes: false}` was ignored for [inline-level quotes]($quote.block) [#5991]

- Added `--deps` and `--deps-format` parameters for emitting a list of files compilation depends on. Supports the three formats `json`, `zero`, and `make`. [#7022]
- Deprecated the `--make-deps` flag in favor of `--deps` with `--deps-format make` [#7022]
- On Linux, the font search will now fall back to known font directories if none were loaded via Fontconfig. [RazrFalcon/fontdb#71]
- The CLI will now warn when trying to watch the standard input [#6381]
- Fixed race condition when two separate Typst CLI processes concurrently try to install a package [#5979]

- Fixed a rare potential crash when stack space couldn't be grown as expected [#6969]

## Tooling and Diagnostics
- Errors in many kinds of external text files (e.g., bibliographies, JSON files, etc.) are now annotated within these files instead of at the positions where the files are loaded from a Typst file [#6308]
- Warnings originating from within [`eval`] are now correctly emitted [#6100]
- Diagnostic messages and hints
  - Improved error messages related to parsing of numbers [#5969]

  - Added hint for a label that appears in both the document and the bibliography [#6457]
  - Added additional hint for show rule recursion depth error [#5856]
  - Fixed inconsistent formatting of code points and strings in error messages [#6487]
- Autocompletion
  - Labels will now be deduplicated in completions [#6516]
  - Math font autocompletions are now based on the presence of an OpenType MATH table instead of the word "Math" in the name [#6316]
  - Autocompletion immediately after a comma in a parameter list is now supported for explicitly triggered completions (e.g. via Ctrl/Cmd+Space) [#6550]
  - Citation style aliases are now displayed as autocompletions [#6696]
  - Fixed autocompletion false positives with cursor after parameter list [#6475]
  - Fixed autocompletion after partial identifier in math [#6415]
  - Fixed which definitions are suggested in math [#6415]
  - Fixed inapplicable method autocompletions being listed [#5824]
- Tooltips
  - Fixed tooltip for scoped functions (e.g. `calc.round`) [#6234]
  - Fixed tooltip and details for figure references [#6580]
  - Expression tooltips now use `Ã—` instead of `x` to indicate a repeated value [#6163]
- Fixed jump from click (jumping to the source panel with a click in the preview) in presence of transformations and clipping [#6037]

## Symbols

- Code points that have a symbol and emoji presentation now have the correct variation selector attached depending on whether they appear in `sym` or `emoji`. That said, they still don't render consistently in Typst due to how font fallback works. [typst/codex#114]
- The [`symbol`] function can now be used to create symbols that comprise not just one character, but one full grapheme cluster [#6489]

## Deprecations
- The name `pdf.embed` in favor of the new name [`pdf.attach`] [#6705]
- The `{"chicago-fullnotes"}` bibliography style in favor of `{"chicago-notes"}` [#6920]
- The `{"modern-humanities-research-association"}` bibliography style in favor of `{"modern-humanities-research-association-notes"}` [#6994]
- The `--make-deps` CLI flag in favor of `--deps` with `--deps-format make` [#7022]
- Various symbols, see the [deprecation section in the dedicated changelog](https://github.com/typst/codex/blob/v0.2.0/CHANGELOG.md#deprecated) for a full listing

## Development
- The `Default` impl for `Library` had to be removed for crate splitting and trait coherence reasons, but you can get a drop-in replacement via `use typst::LibraryExt` [#6576]
- The `PdfOptions` struct has a new `tagged` field, which defaults to `{true}` [#6619] [#7046]
- Fixed a potential panic in `World::font` implementations. Downstream `World` implementations might need to apply [the same fix](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/6117). [#6117]
- Increased minimum supported Rust version to 1.88 [#6637]
- The Docker container now has the optional non-root user `typst` [#7058]
