# Changes in early, unversioned Typst

## March 28, 2023
- **Breaking changes:**
  - Enumerations now require a space after their marker, that is, `[1.ok]` must
    now be written as `[1. ok]`
  - Changed default style for [term lists]($terms): Does not include a colon
    anymore and has a bit more indent

- Command line interface
  - Added `--font-path` argument for CLI
  - Embedded default fonts in CLI binary
  - Fixed build of CLI if `git` is not installed

- Miscellaneous improvements
  - Added support for disabling [matrix]($math.mat) and [vector]($math.vec)
    delimiters. Generally with `[#set math.mat(delim: none)]` or one-off with
    `[$mat(delim: #none, 1, 2; 3, 4)$]`.
  - Added [`separator`]($terms.separator) argument to term lists
  - Added [`round`]($math.round) function for equations
  - Numberings now allow zeros. To reset a counter, you can write
    `[#counter(..).update(0)]`

    [`location`] type
  - Added symbols for double, triple, and quadruple dot accent
  - Added smart quotes for Norwegian Bokm√•l
  - Added Nix flake
  - Fixed bibliography ordering in IEEE style
  - Fixed parsing of decimals in math: `[$1.2/3.4$]`
  - Fixed parsing of unbalanced delimiters in fractions: `[$1/(2 (x)$]`
  - Fixed unexpected parsing of numbers as enumerations, e.g. in `[1.2]`
  - Fixed combination of page fill and header
  - Fixed compiler crash if [`repeat`] is used in page with automatic width
  - Fixed [matrices]($math.mat) with explicit delimiter
  - Fixed [`indent`]($terms.indent) property of term lists
  - Numerous documentation fixes
  - Links in bibliographies are now affected by link styling

## March 21, 2023
- Reference and bibliography management
  - [Bibliographies]($bibliography) and [citations]($cite) (currently supported
    styles are APA, Chicago Author Date, IEEE, and MLA)
  - You can now [reference]($ref) sections, figures, formulas, and works from
    the bibliography with `[@label]`
  - You can make an element referenceable with a label:
    - `[= Introduction <intro>]`
    - `[$ A = pi r^2 $ <area>]`

- Introspection system for interactions between different parts of the document
  - [`counter`] function
    - Access and modify counters for pages, headings, figures, and equations
    - Define and use your own custom counters
    - Time travel: Find out what the counter value was or will be at some other
      point in the document (e.g. when you're building a list of figures, you
      can determine the value of the figure counter at any given figure).
    - Counters count in layout order and not in code order
  - [`state`] function
    - Manage arbitrary state across your document
    - Time travel: Find out the value of your state at any position in the
      document
    - State is modified in layout order and not in code order
  - [`query`] function
    - Find all occurrences of an element or a label, either in the whole
      document or before/after some location
    - Link to elements, find out their position on the pages and access their
      fields
    - Example use cases: Custom list of figures or page header with current
      chapter title
  - [`locate`] function
    - Determines the location of itself in the final layout
    - Can be accessed to get the `page` and `x`, `y` coordinates
    - Can be used with counters and state to find out their values at that
      location
    - Can be used with queries to find elements before or after its location

- New [`measure`] function
  - Measure the layouted size of elements
  - To be used in combination with the new [`style`] function that lets you
    generate different content based on the style context something is inserted
    into (because that affects the measured size of content)

- Exposed content representation
  - Content is not opaque anymore
  - Content can be compared for equality
  - The tree of content elements can be traversed with code
  - Can be observed in hover tooltips or with [`repr`]
  - New [methods]($content) on content: `func`, `has`, `at`, and `location`
  - All optional fields on elements are now settable
  - More uniform field names (`heading.title` becomes `heading.body`,
    `list.items` becomes `list.children`, and a few more changes)

- Further improvements
  - Added [`figure`] function
  - Added [`numbering`]($math.equation.numbering) parameter on equation function
  - Added [`numbering`]($page.numbering) and
    [`number-align`]($page.number-align) parameters on page function
  - The page function's [`header`]($page.header) and [`footer`]($page.footer)
    parameters do not take functions anymore. If you want to customize them
    based on the page number, use the new [`numbering`]($page.numbering)
    parameter or [`counter`] function instead.
  - Added [`footer-descent`]($page.footer-descent) and
    [`header-ascent`]($page.header-ascent) parameters

  block-level. To integrate them into a paragraph, use a [`box`] as with other
  elements.
- A colon is now required in an "everything" show rule: Write `{show: it => ..}`
  instead of `{show it => ..}`. This prevents intermediate states that ruin your
  whole document.
- Non-math content like a shape or table in a math formula is now centered
  vertically

  outline is present

## January 30, 2023
[Go to the announcement blog post.](https://typst.app/blog/2023/january-update)
- New expression syntax in markup/math
  - Blocks cannot be directly embedded in markup anymore
  - Like other expressions, they now require a leading hash
  - More expressions available with hash, including literals (`[#"string"]`) as
    well as field access and method call without space: `[#emoji.face]`
- New import syntax
  - `[#import "module.typ"]` creates binding named `module`
  - `[#import "module.typ": a, b]` or `[#import "module.typ": *]` to import
    items
  - `[#import emoji: face, turtle]` to import from already bound module
- New symbol handling
  - Removed symbol notation
  - Symbols are now in modules: `{sym}`, `{emoji}`, and `{math}`
  - Math module also reexports all of `{sym}`
  - Modified through field access, still order-independent
  - Unknown modifiers are not allowed anymore
  - Support for custom symbol definitions with `symbol` function
  - Symbols now listed in documentation
- New `{math}` module
  - Contains all math-related functions
  - Variables and function calls directly in math (without hash) access this
    module instead of the global scope, but can also access local variables
  - Can be explicitly used in code, e.g. `[#set math.vec(delim: "[")]`
- Delimiter matching in math
   - Any opening delimiters matches any closing one
   - When matched, they automatically scale
   - To prevent scaling, escape them
   - To forcibly match two delimiters, use `lr` function
   - Line breaks may occur between matched delimiters
   - Delimiters may also be unbalanced
   - You can also use the `lr` function to scale the brackets (or just one
     bracket) to a specific size manually
- Multi-line math with alignment
  - The `\` character inserts a line break
  - The `&` character defines an alignment point
  - Alignment points also work for underbraces, vectors, cases, and matrices
  - Multiple alignment points are supported
- More capable math function calls
  - Function calls directly in math can now take code expressions with hash
  - They can now also take named arguments
  - Within math function calls, semicolons turn preceding arguments to arrays to
    support matrices: `[$mat(1, 2; 3, 4)$]`
- Arbitrary content in math
  - Text, images, and other arbitrary content can now be embedded in math
  - Math now also supports font fallback to support e.g. CJK and emoji
- More math features
  - New text operators: `op` function, `lim`, `max`, etc.
  - New matrix function: `mat`
  - New n-ary roots with `root` function: `[$root(3, x)$]`
  - New under- and overbraces, -brackets, and -lines
  - New `abs` and `norm` functions
  - New shorthands: `[|`, `|]`, and `||`
  - New `attach` function, overridable attachments with `script` and `limit`
  - Manual spacing in math, with `h`, `thin`, `med`, `thick` and `quad`
  - Symbols and other content may now be used like a function, e.g.
    `[$zeta(x)$]`
  - Added Fira Math font, removed Noto Sans Math font
  - Support for alternative math fonts through `[#show math.formula: set
    text("Fira Math")]`
- More library improvements
  - New `calc` module, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `even`, `odd` and `mod` moved there
  - New `message` argument on `{assert}` function
  - The `pairs` method on dictionaries now returns an array of length-2 arrays
    instead of taking a closure
  - The method call `{dict.at("key")}` now always fails if `"key"` doesn't exist
    Previously, it was allowed in assignments. Alternatives are `{dict.key = x}`
    and `{dict.insert("key", x)}`.
- Smarter editor functionality
  - Autocompletion for local variables
  - Autocompletion for methods available on a value
