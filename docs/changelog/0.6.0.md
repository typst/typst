# Version 0.6.0 (June 30, 2023)

## Package Management
- Typst now has built-in [package management]($scripting/#packages)
- You can import [published]($universe) community packages or create and use
  [system-local](https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages) ones
- Published packages are also supported in the web app

## Math
- Added support for optical size variants of glyphs in math mode
- Added argument to enable [`limits`]($math.limits) conditionally depending on
  whether the equation is set in [`display`]($math.display) or
  [`inline`]($math.inline) style
- Added `gt.eq.slant` and `lt.eq.slant` symbols
- Increased precedence of factorials in math mode (`[$1/n!$]` works correctly
  now)
- Improved [underlines]($math.underline) and [overlines]($math.overline) in
  math mode
- Fixed usage of [`limits`]($math.limits) function in show rules
- Fixed bugs with line breaks in equations

## Text and Layout
- Added support for alternating page [margins]($page.margin) with the `inside`
  and `outside` keys
- Added support for specifying the page [`binding`]($page.binding)
- Added [`to`]($pagebreak.to) argument to pagebreak function to skip to the
  next even or odd page
- Added basic i18n for a few more languages (TR, SQ, TL)
- Fixed bug with missing table row at page break
- Fixed bug with [underlines]($underline)
- Fixed bug superfluous table lines
- Fixed smart quotes after line breaks
- Fixed a crash related to text layout

## Command line interface
- **Breaking change:** Added requirement for `--root`/`TYPST_ROOT` directory
  to contain the input file because it designates the _project_ root. Existing
  setups that use `TYPST_ROOT` to emulate package management should switch to
  [local packages](https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages)
- **Breaking change:** Now denies file access outside of the project root
- Added support for local packages and on-demand package download
- Now watches all relevant files, within the root and all packages
- Now displays compilation time

## Miscellaneous Improvements
- Added [`outline.entry`]($outline.entry) to customize outline entries with
  show rules
- Added some hints for error messages
- Added some missing syntaxes for [`raw`] highlighting
- Improved rendering of rotated images in PNG export and web app
- Made [footnotes]($footnote) reusable and referenceable
- Fixed bug with citations and bibliographies in [`locate`]
- Fixed inconsistent tense in documentation

## Development
- Added [contribution guide](https://github.com/typst/typst/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Reworked `World` interface to accommodate for package management and make
  it a bit simpler to implement _(Breaking change for implementors)_
