## Visualization

  colors is now a named parameter (**Breaking change**)
- Added support for the [Oklch]($color.oklch) color space
- Improved conversions between colors in different color spaces
- Removed restrictions on [Oklab]($color.oklab) chroma component

- Improved default [figure caption separator]($figure.caption.separator) for
  Chinese, French, and Russian
- Changed default [figure supplement]($figure.supplement) for Russian to short
  form
- Fixed [CJK-Latin-spacing]($text.cjk-latin-spacing) before line breaks and in

## Math
- Added [`mid`]($math.mid) function for scaling a delimiter up to the height of
  the surrounding [`lr`]($math.lr) group
- The [`op`]($math.op) function can now take any content, not just strings
- Improved documentation for [math alignment]($category/math/#alignment)
- Fixed swallowing of trailing comma when a symbol is used in a function-like
  way (e.g. `pi(a,b,)`)

## Scripting
- Any non-identifier dictionary key is now interpreted as an expression: For
  instance, `{((key): value)}` will create a dictionary with a dynamic key
- The [`stroke`] type now has a constructor that converts a value to a stroke or
  creates one from its parts
- Added constructor for [`arguments`] type
- Added [`calc.div-euclid`]($calc.div-euclid) and
  [`calc.rem-euclid`]($calc.rem-euclid) functions

- Fixed [`repr`]of [`cmyk`]($color.cmyk) colors
- Fixed crashes with provided elements like figure captions, outline entries,
  and footnote entries

## Tooling and Diagnostics
- Show rules that match on their own output now produce an appropriate error
  message instead of a crash (this is a first step, in the future they will just
  work)

  crashes

- Added hint when trying to use a manually constructed footnote or outline entry
- Added missing details to autocompletions for types
- Improved error message when passing a named argument where a positional one is
  expected

  document's [`date`]($document.date) is set manually
- Fixed color export in SVG
- Fixed PDF metadata encoding of multiple [authors]($document.author)

## Command line interface
- Fixed a major bug where `typst watch` would confuse files and fail to pick up
  updates
- Fetching of the release metadata in `typst update` now respects proxies
- Fixed bug with `--open` flag on Windows when the path contains a space
- The `TYPST_FONT_PATHS` environment variable can now contain multiple paths
  (separated by `;` on Windows and `:` elsewhere)

  UTF-8

## Miscellaneous Improvements
- Parallelized image encoding in PDF export
- Improved the internal representation of content for improved performance
- Optimized introspection (query, counter, etc.) performance
- The [document title]($document.title) can now be arbitrary content instead of
  just a string
- The [`number-align`]($enum.number-align) parameter on numbered lists now also
  accepts vertical alignments

- Fixed parsing of `[#return]` expression in markup
- Fixed bug where inline equations were displayed in equation outlines

  `typst-render` into separate crates
- The Nix flake now includes the git revision when running `typst --version`
