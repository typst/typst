# Version 0.4.0 (May 20, 2023)

## Footnotes
- Implemented support for footnotes
- The [`footnote`] function inserts a footnote
- The [`footnote.entry`]($footnote.entry) function can be used to customize the
  footnote listing
- The `{"chicago-notes"}` [citation style]($cite.style) is now available

## Documentation
- Added a [Guide for LaTeX users]($guides/guide-for-latex-users)
- Now shows default values for optional arguments
- Added richer outlines in "On this Page"
- Added initial support for search keywords: "Table of Contents" will now find
  the [outline] function. Suggestions for more keywords are welcome!
- Fixed issue with search result ranking
- Fixed many more small issues

## Math
- **Breaking change**: Alignment points (`&`) in equations now alternate between
  left and right alignment
- Added support for writing roots with Unicode: For example, `[$root(x+y)$]` can
  now also be written as `[$âˆš(x+y)$]`
- Fixed uneven vertical [`attachment`]($math.attach) alignment
- Fixed spacing on decorated elements (e.g., spacing around a
  [canceled]($math.cancel) operator)
- Fixed styling for stretchable symbols
- Added `tack.r.double`, `tack.l.double`, `dotless.i` and `dotless.j`
  [symbols]($category/symbols/sym)
- Fixed show rules on symbols (e.g. `{show sym.tack: set text(blue)}`)
- Fixed missing rename from `ast.op` to `ast` that should have been in the
  previous release

## Scripting
- Added function scopes: A function can now hold related definitions in its own
  scope, similar to a module. The new [`assert.eq`]($assert.eq) function, for
  instance, is part of the [`assert`] function's scope. Note that function
  scopes are currently only available for built-in functions.
- Added [`assert.eq`]($assert.eq) and [`assert.ne`]($assert.ne) functions for
  simpler equality and inequality assertions with more helpful error messages
- Exposed [list]($list.item), [enum]($enum.item), and [term list]($terms.item)
  items in their respective functions' scope
- The `at` methods on [strings]($str.at), [arrays]($array.at),
  [dictionaries]($dictionary.at), and [content]($content.at) now support
  specifying a default value
- Added support for passing a function to [`replace`]($str.replace) that is
  called with each match.
- Fixed [replacement]($str.replace) strings: They are now inserted completely
  verbatim instead of supporting the previous (unintended) magic dollar syntax
  for capture groups
- Fixed bug with trailing placeholders in destructuring patterns
- Fixed bug with underscore in parameter destructuring
- Fixed crash with nested patterns and when hovering over an invalid pattern
- Better error messages when casting to an [integer]($int) or [float]($float)
  fails

## Text and Layout
- Implemented sophisticated CJK punctuation adjustment
- Disabled [overhang]($text.overhang) for CJK punctuation
- Added basic translations for Traditional Chinese
- Fixed [alignment]($raw.align) of text inside raw blocks (centering a raw
  block, e.g. through a figure, will now keep the text itself left-aligned)
- Added support for passing a array instead of a function to configure table
  cell [alignment]($table.align) and [fill]($table.fill) per column
- Fixed automatic figure [`kind`]($figure.kind) detection
- Made alignment of [enum numbers]($enum.number-align) configurable, defaulting
  to `end`
- Figures can now be made breakable with a show-set rule for blocks in figure
- Initial fix for smart quotes in RTL languages

## Export
- Fixed ligatures in PDF export: They are now copyable and searchable
- Exported PDFs now embed ICC profiles for images that have them
- Fixed export of strokes with zero thickness

## Web app
- Projects can now contain folders
- Added upload by drag-and-drop into the file panel
- Files from the file panel can now be dragged into the editor to insert them
  into a Typst file
- You can now copy-paste images and other files from your computer directly into
  the editor
- Added a button to resend confirmation email
- Added an option to invert preview colors in dark mode
- Added tips to the loading screen and the Help menu. Feel free to propose more!
- Added syntax highlighting for YAML files
- Allowed middle mouse button click on many buttons to navigate into a new tab
- Allowed more project names
- Fixed overridden Vim mode keybindings
- Fixed many bugs regarding file upload and more

## Miscellaneous Improvements
- Improved performance of counters, state, and queries
- Improved incremental parsing for more efficient recompilations
- Added support for `.yaml` extension in addition to `.yml` for bibliographies
- The CLI now emits escape codes only if the output is a TTY
- For users of the `typst` crate: The `Document` is now `Sync` again and the
  `World` doesn't have to be `'static` anymore
