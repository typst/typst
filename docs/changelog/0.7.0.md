# Version 0.7.0 (August 7, 2023)

## Text and Layout
- Added support for floating figures through the
  [`placement`]($figure.placement) argument on the figure function
- Added support for arbitrary floating content through the
  [`float`]($place.float) argument on the place function
- Added support for loading `.sublime-syntax` files as highlighting
  [syntaxes]($raw.syntaxes) for raw blocks
- Added support for loading `.tmTheme` files as highlighting
  [themes]($raw.theme) for raw blocks
- Added _bounds_ option to [`top-edge`]($text.top-edge) and
  [`bottom-edge`]($text.bottom-edge) arguments of text function for tight
  bounding boxes
- Removed nonsensical top- and bottom-edge options, e.g. _ascender_ for the
  bottom edge (**Breaking change**)
- Added [`script`]($text.script) argument to text function
- Added [`alternative`]($smartquote.alternative) argument to smart quote
  function
- Added basic i18n for Japanese
- Added hyphenation support for `nb` and `nn` language codes in addition to `no`
- Fixed positioning of [placed elements]($place) in containers
- Fixed overflowing containers due to optimized line breaks

## Export
- Greatly improved export of SVG images to PDF. Many thanks to
  [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV) for their work on this.
- Added support for the alpha channel of RGBA colors in PDF export
- Fixed a bug with PPI (pixels per inch) for PNG export

## Math
- Improved layout of primes (e.g. in `[$a'_1$]`)
- Improved display of multi-primes (e.g. in `[$a''$]`)
- Improved layout of [roots]($math.root)
- Changed relations to show attachments as [limits]($math.limits) by default
  (e.g. in `[$a ->^x b$]`)
- Large operators and delimiters are now always vertically centered
- [Boxes]($box) in equations now sit on the baseline instead of being vertically
  centered by default. Notably, this does not affect [blocks]($block) because
  they are not inline elements.
- Added support for [weak spacing]($h.weak)
- Added support for OpenType character variants
- Added support for customizing the [math class]($math.class) of content
- Fixed spacing around `.`, `\/`, and `...`
- Fixed spacing between closing delimiters and large operators
- Fixed a bug with math font weight selection
- Symbols and Operators (**Breaking changes**)
  - Added `id`, `im`, and `tr` text [operators]($math.op)
  - Renamed `ident` to `equiv` with alias `eq.triple` and removed `ident.strict`
    in favor of `eq.quad`
  - Renamed `ast.sq` to `ast.square` and `integral.sq` to `integral.square`
  - Renamed `.eqq` modifier to `.equiv` (and `.neqq` to `.nequiv`) for `tilde`,
    `gt`, `lt`, `prec`, and `succ`
  - Added `emptyset` as alias for `nothing`
  - Added `lt.curly` and `gt.curly` as aliases for `prec` and `succ`
  - Added `aleph`, `beth`, and `gimmel` as alias for `alef`, `bet`, and `gimel`

## Scripting
- Fields
  - Added `abs` and `em` field to [lengths]($length)
  - Added `ratio` and `length` field to [relative lengths]($relative)
  - Added `x` and `y` field to [2d alignments]($align.alignment)
  - Added `paint`, `thickness`, `cap`, `join`, `dash`, and `miter-limit` field
    to [strokes]($stroke)
- Accessor and utility methods
  - Added [`dedup`]($array.dedup) method to arrays
  - Added `pt`, `mm`, `cm`, and `inches` method to [lengths]($length)
  - Added `deg` and `rad` method to [angles]($angle)
  - Added `kind`, `hex`, `rgba`, `cmyk`, and `luma` method to [colors]($color)
  - Added `axis`, `start`, `end`, and `inv` method to [directions]($stack.dir)
  - Added `axis` and `inv` method to [alignments]($align.alignment)
  - Added `inv` method to [2d alignments]($align.alignment)
  - Added `start` argument to [`enumerate`]($array.enumerate) method on arrays
- Added [`color.mix`]($color.mix) function
- Added `mode` and `scope` arguments to [`eval`] function
- Added [`bytes`] type for holding large byte buffers
  - Added [`encoding`]($read.encoding) argument to read function to read a file
    as bytes instead of a string
  - Added [`image.decode`]($image.decode) function for decoding an image
    directly from a string or bytes
  - Added [`bytes`] function for converting a string or an array of integers to
    bytes
  - Added [`array`] function for converting bytes to an array of integers
  - Added support for converting bytes to a string with the [`str`] function

## Tooling and Diagnostics
- Added support for compiler warnings
- Added warning when compilation does not converge within five attempts due to
  intense use of introspection features
- Added warnings for empty emphasis (`__` and `**`)
- Improved error message for invalid field assignments
- Improved error message after single `#`
- Improved error message when a keyword is used where an identifier is expected
- Fixed parameter autocompletion for functions that are in modules
- Import autocompletion now only shows the latest package version until a colon
  is typed
- Fixed autocompletion for dictionary key containing a space
- Fixed autocompletion for `for` loops

## Command line interface
- Added `typst query` subcommand to execute a
  [query]($reference/introspection/query/#command-line-queries) on the command
  line
- The `--root` and `--font-paths` arguments cannot appear in front of the
  command anymore (**Breaking change**)
- Local and cached packages are now stored in directories of the form
  `[{namespace}/{name}/{version}]` instead of `[{namespace}/{name}-{version}]`
  (**Breaking change**)
- Now prioritizes explicitly given fonts (via `--font-paths`) over system and
  embedded fonts when both exist
- Fixed `typst watch` not working with some text editors
- Fixed displayed compilation time (now includes export)

## Miscellaneous Improvements
- Added [`bookmarked`]($heading.bookmarked) argument to heading to control
  whether a heading becomes part of the PDF outline
- Added [`caption-pos`]($figure.caption.position) argument to control the
  position of a figure's caption
- Added [`metadata`] function for exposing an arbitrary value to the
  introspection system
- Fixed that a [`state`] was identified by the pair `(key, init)` instead of
  just its `key`
- Improved indent logic of [enumerations]($enum). Instead of requiring at least
  as much indent as the end of the marker, they now require only one more space
  indent than the start of the marker. As a result, even long markers like `12.`
  work with just 2 spaces of indent.
- Fixed bug with indent logic of [`raw`] blocks
- Fixed a parsing bug with dictionaries

## Development
- Extracted parser and syntax tree into `typst-syntax` crate
- The `World::today` implementation of Typst dependents may need fixing if they
  have the same [bug](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1842) that the CLI
  world had
