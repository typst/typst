# Community
Hey and welcome to the Community page! We're so glad you're here. Typst is
developed by an early-stage startup and is still in its infancy, but it would be
pointless without people like you who are interested in it.

We would love to not only hear from you but to also provide spaces where you can
discuss any topic around Typst, typesetting, writing, the sciences, and
typography with other likeminded people.

For the time being, **we would like to invite you to our [Discord
server](https://discord.gg/2uDybryKPe).** The server is open for everyone.
Of course, you are also very welcome to connect with us on social media
([Twitter](https://twitter.com/typstapp/),
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/typstapp/),
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/typst), and
[GitHub](https://github.com/typst)).

## What to share?
For our community, we want to foster versatility and inclusivity. You are
welcome to post about any topic that you think would interest other community
members, but if you need a little inspiration, here are a few ideas:

- Share and discuss your thoughts and ideas for new features or improvements
  you'd like to see in Typst
- Showcase documents you've created with Typst, or share any unique or creative
  ways you've used the platform
- Share importable files or templates that you use to style your documents
- Alert us of bugs you encounter while using Typst

## Beta test
We are starting a public beta test of our product on March 21st, 2023. The Typst
compiler is still under active development and breaking changes can occur at any
point. The compiler is developed in the open on
[GitHub](https://github.com/typst/typst).

We will update the members of our Discord server and our social media followers
when new features become available. We'll also update you on the development
progress of large features.
