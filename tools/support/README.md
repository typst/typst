# Language support
This VS Code extension provides minimal language support for Typst. It contains
a syntax definition and a language configuration for comment toggling,
autoclosing etc.

The extension was created for development purposes only. It is not maintained
and its grammar is not 100% accurate. For a more actively developed extension
see the third-party [Typst LSP](https://github.com/nvarner/typst-lsp).
