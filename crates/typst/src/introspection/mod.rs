/// This category is home to Typst's introspection capabilities: With the
/// `counter` function, you can access and manipulate page, section, figure, and
/// equation counters or create custom ones. Meanwhile, the `query` function
/// lets you search for elements in the document to construct things like a list
/// of figures or headers which show the current chapter title.
///
/// Most of the functions are _contextual._ It is recommended to read the chapter
/// on [context]($context) before continuing here.
