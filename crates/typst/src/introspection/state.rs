/// Manages stateful parts of your document.
///
/// Let's say you have some computations in your document and want to remember
/// the result of your last computation to use it in the next one. You might try
/// something similar to the code below and expect it to output 10, 13, 26, and
/// 21. However this **does not work** in Typst. If you test this code, you will
/// see that Typst complains with the following error message: _Variables from
/// outside the function are read-only and cannot be modified._
///
/// ```typ
/// // This doesn't work!
/// #let x = 0
/// #let compute(expr) = {
///   x = eval(
///     expr.replace("x", str(x))
///   )
///   [New value is #x. ]
/// }
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// #compute("x * 2") \
/// #compute("x - 5")
/// ```
///
/// # State and document markup { #state-and-markup }
/// Why does it do that? Because, in general, this kind of computation with side
/// effects is problematic in document markup and Typst is upfront about that.
/// For the results to make sense, the computation must proceed in the same
/// order in which the results will be laid out in the document. In our simple
/// example, that's the case, but in general it might not be.
///
/// Let's look at a slightly different, but similar kind of state: The heading
/// numbering. We want to increase the heading counter at each heading. Easy
/// enough, right? Just add one. Well, it's not that simple. Consider the
/// following example:
///
/// ```example
/// #set heading(numbering: "1.")
/// #let template(body) = [
///   = Outline
///   ...
///   #body
/// ]
///
/// #show: template
///
/// = Introduction
/// ...
/// ```
///
/// Here, Typst first processes the body of the document after the show rule,
/// sees the `Introduction` heading, then passes the resulting content to the
/// `template` function and only then sees the `Outline`. Just counting up would
/// number the `Introduction` with `1` and the `Outline` with `2`.
///
/// # Managing state in Typst { #state-in-typst }
/// So what do we do instead? We use Typst's state management system. Calling
/// the `state` function with an identifying string key and an optional initial
/// value gives you a state value which exposes a few function. The two most
/// important ones are `get` and `update`:
///
/// - The [`get`]($state.get) function retrieves the current value of the state.
///   Because the value can vary over the course of the document, it is a
///   _contextual_ function that can only be used when [context]($context) is
///   available.
///
/// - The [`update`]($state.update) function modifies the state. You can give it
///   any value. If given a non-function value, it sets the state to that value.
///   If given a function, that function receives the previous state and has to
///   return the new state.
///
/// Our initial example would now look like this:
///
/// ```example
/// #let s = state("x", 0)
/// #let compute(expr) = [
///   #s.update(x =>
///     eval(expr.replace("x", str(x)))
///   )
///   New value is #context s.get().
/// ]
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// #compute("x * 2") \
/// #compute("x - 5")
/// ```
///
/// State managed by Typst is always updated in layout order, not in evaluation
/// order. The `update` method returns content and its effect occurs at the
/// position where the returned content is inserted into the document.
///
/// As a result, we can now also store some of the computations in variables,
/// but they still show the correct results:
///
/// ```example
/// >>> #let s = state("x", 0)
/// >>> #let compute(expr) = [
/// >>>   #s.update(x =>
/// >>>     eval(expr.replace("x", str(x)))
/// >>>   )
/// >>>   New value is #context s.get().
/// >>> ]
/// <<< ...
///
/// #let more = [
///   #compute("x * 2") \
///   #compute("x - 5")
/// ]
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// #more
/// ```
///
/// This example is of course a bit silly, but in practice this is often exactly
/// what you want! A good example are heading counters, which is why Typst's
/// [counting system]($counter) is very similar to its state system.
///
/// # Time Travel
/// By using Typst's state management system you also get time travel
/// capabilities! We can find out what the value of the state will be at any
/// position in the document from anywhere else. In particular, the `at` method
/// gives us the value of the state at any particular location and the `final`
/// methods gives us the value of the state at the end of the document.
///
/// ```example
/// >>> #let s = state("x", 0)
/// >>> #let compute(expr) = [
/// >>>   #s.update(x => {
/// >>>     eval(expr.replace("x", str(x)))
/// >>>   })
/// >>>   New value is #context s.get().
/// >>> ]
/// <<< ...
///
/// Value at `<here>` is
/// #context s.at(<here>)
///
/// #compute("10") \
/// #compute("x + 3") \
/// *Here.* <here> \
/// #compute("x * 2") \
/// #compute("x - 5")
/// ```
///
/// # A word of caution { #caution }
/// To resolve the values of all states, Typst evaluates parts of your code
/// multiple times. However, there is no guarantee that your state manipulation
/// can actually be completely resolved.
///
/// For instance, if you generate state updates depending on the final value of
/// a state, the results might never converge. The example below illustrates
/// this. We initialize our state with `1` and then update it to its own final
/// value plus 1. So it should be `2`, but then its final value is `2`, so it
/// should be `3`, and so on. This example displays a finite value because Typst
/// simply gives up after a few attempts.
///
/// ```example
/// // This is bad!
/// #let s = state("x", 1)
/// #context s.update(s.final() + 1)
/// #context s.get()
/// ```
///
/// In general, you should try not to generate state updates from within context
/// expressions. If possible, try to express your updates as non-contextual
/// values or functions that compute the new value from the previous value.
/// Sometimes, it cannot be helped, but in those cases it is up to you to ensure
/// that the result converges.
