/// Provides the current location in the document.
///
/// You can think of `here` as a low-level building block that directly extracts
/// the current location from the active [context]($context). Some other
/// functions use it internally: For instance, `{counter.get()}` is equivalent
/// to `{counter.at(here())}`.
///
/// Within show rules on [locatable]($location/#locatable) elements, `{here()}`
/// will match the location of the shown element.
///
/// If you want to display the current page number, refer to the documentation
/// of the [`counter`]($counter) type. While `here` can be used to determine the
/// physical page number, typically you want the logical page number that may,
/// for instance, have been reset after a preface.
///
/// # Examples
/// Determining the current position in the document in combination with
/// [`locate`]($locate):
/// ```example
/// #context [
///   I am located at
///   #here().position()
/// ]
/// ```
///
/// Running a [query]($query) for elements before the current position:
/// ```example
/// = Introduction
/// = Background
///
/// There are
/// #context query(
///   selector(heading).before(here())
/// ).len()
/// headings before me.
///
/// = Conclusion
/// ```
/// Refer to the [`selector`]($selector) type for more details on before/after
/// selectors.
