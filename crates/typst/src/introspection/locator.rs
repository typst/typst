/// Provides locations for elements in the document.

/// A [`Location`] consists of an element's hash plus a disambiguator. Just the
/// hash is not enough because we can have multiple equal elements with the same
/// hash (not a hash collision, just equal elements!). Between these, we
/// disambiguate with an increasing number. In principle, the disambiguator
/// could just be counted up. However, counting is an impure operation and as
/// such we can't count across a memoization boundary. [^1]
///
/// Instead, we only mutate within a single "layout run" and combine the results
/// with disambiguators from an outer tracked locator. Thus, the locators form a
/// "tracked chain". When a layout run ends, its mutations are discarded and, on
/// the other side of the memoization boundary, we
/// [reconstruct](Self::visit_frame) them from the resulting [frames](Frame).
///
/// [^1]: Well, we could with [`TrackedMut`](comemo::TrackedMut), but the
/// overhead is quite high, especially since we need to save & undo the counting
/// when only measuring.
