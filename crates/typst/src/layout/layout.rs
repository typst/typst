/// Provides access to the current outer container's (or page's, if none) size
/// (width and height).
///
/// The given function must accept a single parameter, `size`, which is a
/// dictionary with keys `width` and `height`, both of type [`length`]($length).
///
/// ```example
/// #let text = lorem(30)
/// #layout(size => [
///   #let (height,) = measure(
///     block(width: size.width, text),
///   )
///   This text is #height high with
///   the current page width: \
///   #text
/// ])
/// ```
///
/// If the `layout` call is placed inside of a box width a width of `{800pt}`
/// and a height of `{400pt}`, then the specified function will be given the
/// parameter `{(width: 800pt, height: 400pt)}`. If it placed directly into the
/// page it receives the page's dimensions minus its margins. This is mostly
/// useful in combination with [measurement]($measure).
///
/// You can also use this function to resolve [`ratio`]($ratio) to fixed
/// lengths. This might come in handy if you're building your own layout
/// abstractions.
///
/// ```example
/// #layout(size => {
///   let half = 50% * size.width
///   [Half a page is #half wide.]
/// })
/// ```
///
/// Note that this function will provide an infinite width or height if one of
/// the page width or height is `auto`, respectively.
