/// A logical subdivison of textual content.

/// Typst automatically collects _inline-level_ elements into paragraphs.
/// Inline-level elements include [text], [horizontal spacing]($h),
/// [boxes]($box), and [inline equations]($math.equation).
///
/// To separate paragraphs, use a blank line (or an explicit [`parbreak`]).
/// Paragraphs are also automatically interrupted by any block-level element
/// (like [`block`], [`place`], or anything that shows itself as one of these).
///
/// The `par` element is primarily used in set rules to affect paragraph
/// properties, but it can also be used to explicitly display its argument as a
/// paragraph of its own. Then, the paragraph's body may not contain any
/// block-level content.
///
/// # Boxes and blocks
/// As explained above, usually paragraphs only contain inline-level content.
/// However, you can integrate any kind of block-level content into a paragraph
/// by wrapping it in a [`box`].
///
/// Conversely, you can separate inline-level content from a paragraph by
/// wrapping it in a [`block`]. In this case, it will not become part of any
/// paragraph at all. Read the following section for an explanation of why that
/// matters and how it differs from just adding paragraph breaks around the
/// content.
///
/// # What becomes a paragraph?
/// When you add inline-level content to your document, Typst will automatically
/// wrap it in paragraphs. However, a typical document also contains some text
/// that is not semantically part of a paragraph, for example in a heading or
/// caption.
///
/// The rules for when Typst wraps inline-level content in a paragraph are as
/// follows:
///
/// - All text at the root of a document is wrapped in paragraphs.
///
/// - Text in a container (like a `block`) is only wrapped in a paragraph if the
///   container holds any block-level content. If all of the contents are
///   inline-level, no paragraph is created.
///
/// In the laid-out document, it's not immediately visible whether text became
/// part of a paragraph. However, it is still important for various reasons:
///
/// - Certain paragraph styling like `first-line-indent` will only apply to
///   proper paragraphs, not any text. Similarly, `par` show rules of course
///   only trigger on paragraphs.
///
/// - A proper distinction between paragraphs and other text helps people who
///   rely on Assistive Technology (AT) (such as screen readers) navigate and
///   understand the document properly.
///
/// - PDF export will generate a `P` tag only for paragraphs.
/// - HTML export will generate a `<p>` tag only for paragraphs.
///
/// When creating custom reusable components, you can and should take charge
/// over whether Typst creates paragraphs. By wrapping text in a [`block`]
/// instead of just adding paragraph breaks around it, you can force the absence
/// of a paragraph. Conversely, by adding a [`parbreak`] after some content in a
/// container, you can force it to become a paragraph even if it's just one
/// word. This is, for example, what [non-`tight`]($list.tight) lists do to
/// force their items to become paragraphs.
///
/// # Example
/// ```example
/// #set par(
///   first-line-indent: 1em,
///   spacing: 0.65em,
///   justify: true,
/// )
///
/// We proceed by contradiction.
/// Suppose that there exists a set
/// of positive integers $a$, $b$, and
/// $c$ that satisfies the equation
/// $a^n + b^n = c^n$ for some
/// integer value of $n > 2$.
///
/// Without loss of generality,
/// let $a$ be the smallest of the
/// three integers. Then, we ...

    /// The `min` keys define down to which lower bound gaps may be shrunk while
    /// the `max` keys define up to which upper bound they may be stretched.
    ///
    /// - The `spacing` entry defines how much the width of spaces between words
    ///   may be adjusted. It is closely related to [`text.spacing`] and its
    ///   `min` and `max` keys accept [relative lengths]($relative), just like
    ///   the `spacing` property.
    ///
    ///   A `min` value of `{100%}` means that spaces should retain their normal
    ///   size (i.e. not be shrunk), while a value of `{90% - 0.01em}` would
    ///   indicate that a space can be shrunk to a width of 90% of its normal
    ///   width minus 0.01Ã— the current font size. Similarly, a `max` value of
    ///   `{100% + 0.02em}` means that a space's width can be increased by 0.02Ã—
    ///   the current font size. The ratio part must always be positive. The
    ///   length part, meanwhile, must not be positive for `min` and not be
    ///   negative for `max`.
    ///
    ///   Note that spaces may still be expanded beyond the `max` value if there
    ///   is no way to justify the line otherwise. However, other means of
    ///   justification (e.g. spacing apart characters if the `tracking` entry
    ///   is configured accordingly) are first used to their maximum.
    ///
    /// - The `tracking` entry defines how much the spacing between letters may
    ///   be adjusted. It is closely related to [`text.tracking`] and its `min`
    ///   and `max` keys accept [lengths]($length), just like the `tracking`
    ///   property. Unlike `spacing`, it does not accept relative lengths
    ///   because the base of the relative length would vary for each character,
    ///   leading to an uneven visual appearance. The behavior compared to
    ///   `spacing` is as if the base was `{100%}`.
    ///
    ///   Otherwise, the `min` and `max` values work just like for `spacing`. A
    ///   `max` value of `{0.01em}` means that additional spacing amounting to
    ///   0.01Ã— of the current font size may be inserted between every pair of
    ///   characters. Note that this also includes the gaps between spaces and
    ///   characters, so for spaces the values of `tracking` act in addition to
    ///   the values for `spacing`.
    ///
    /// If you only specify one of `spacing` or `tracking`, the other retains
    /// its previously set value (or the default if it was not previously set).
    ///
    /// If you want to enable character-level justification, a good value for
    /// the `min` and `max` keys is around `{0.01em}` to `{0.02em}` (negated for
    /// `min`). Using the same value for both gives a good baseline, but
    /// tweaking the two values individually may produce more balanced results,
    /// as demonstrated in the example below. Be careful not to set the bounds
