/// Finds elements in the document.
///
/// The `query` functions lets you search your document for elements of a
/// particular type or with a particular label. To use it, you first need to
/// ensure that [context] is available.
///

/// # Finding elements
/// In the example below, we manually create a table of contents instead of
/// using the [`outline`] function.
///
/// To do this, we first query for all headings in the document at level 1 and
/// where `outlined` is true. Querying only for headings at level 1 ensures
/// that, for the purpose of this example, sub-headings are not included in the
/// table of contents. The `outlined` field is used to exclude the "Table of
/// Contents" heading itself.
///
/// Note that we open a `context` to be able to use the `query` function.
///
/// ```example
/// >>> #set page(
/// >>>  width: 240pt,
/// >>>  height: 180pt,
/// >>>  margin: (top: 20pt, bottom: 35pt)
/// >>> )
/// #set page(numbering: "1")
///
/// #heading(outlined: false)[
///   Table of Contents
/// ]
/// #context {
///   let chapters = query(
///     heading.where(
///       level: 1,
///       outlined: true,
///     )
///   )
///   for chapter in chapters {
///     let loc = chapter.location()
///     let nr = numbering(
///       loc.page-numbering(),
///       ..counter(page).at(loc),
///     )
///     [#chapter.body #h(1fr) #nr \ ]
///   }
/// }
///
/// = Introduction
/// #lorem(10)
/// #pagebreak()
///
/// == Sub-Heading
/// #lorem(8)
///
/// = Discussion
/// #lorem(18)
/// ```
///
/// To get the page numbers, we first get the location of the elements returned
/// by `query` with [`location`]($content.location). We then also retrieve the
/// [page numbering]($location.page-numbering) and [page
/// counter]($counter/#page-counter) at that location and apply the numbering to
/// the counter.
///
/// # A word of caution { #caution }
/// To resolve all your queries, Typst evaluates and layouts parts of the
/// document multiple times. However, there is no guarantee that your queries
/// can actually be completely resolved. If you aren't careful a query can
/// affect itselfâ€”leading to a result that never stabilizes.
///
/// In the example below, we query for all headings in the document. We then
/// generate as many headings. In the beginning, there's just one heading,
/// titled `Real`. Thus, `count` is `1` and one `Fake` heading is generated.
/// Typst sees that the query's result has changed and processes it again. This
/// time, `count` is `2` and two `Fake` headings are generated. This goes on and
/// on. As we can see, the output has a finite amount of headings. This is
/// because Typst simply gives up after a few attempts.
///
/// In general, you should try not to write queries that affect themselves. The
/// same words of caution also apply to other introspection features like
/// [counters]($counter) and [state].
///
/// ```example
/// = Real
/// #context {
///   let elems = query(heading)
///   let count = elems.len()
///   count * [= Fake]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Command line queries
/// You can also perform queries from the command line with the `typst query`
/// command. This command executes an arbitrary query on the document and
/// returns the resulting elements in serialized form. Consider the following
/// `example.typ` file which contains some invisible [metadata]:
///
/// ```typ
/// #metadata("This is a note") <note>
/// ```
///
/// You can execute a query on it as follows using Typst's CLI:
/// ```sh
/// $ typst query example.typ "<note>"
/// [
///   {
///     "func": "metadata",
///     "value": "This is a note",
///     "label": "<note>"
///   }
/// ]
/// ```
///
/// Frequently, you're interested in only one specific field of the resulting
/// elements. In the case of the `metadata` element, the `value` field is the
/// interesting one. You can extract just this field with the `--field`
/// argument.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ typst query example.typ "<note>" --field value
/// ["This is a note"]
/// ```
///
/// If you are interested in just a single element, you can use the `--one`
/// flag to extract just it.
///
/// ```sh
/// $ typst query example.typ "<note>" --field value --one
/// "This is a note"
/// ```
