/// access its absolute position on the pages. You can retrieve the current
/// location with the [`here`] function and the location of a queried or shown
/// element with the [`location()`]($content.location) method on content.

/// Currently, only a subset of element functions is locatable. Aside from
/// headings and figures, this includes equations, references, quotes and all
/// elements with an explicit label. As a result, you _can_ query for e.g.
/// [`strong`] elements, but you will find only those that have an explicit
/// label attached to them. This limitation will be resolved in the future.
