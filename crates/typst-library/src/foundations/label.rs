/// A label for an element.
///
/// Inserting a label into content attaches it to the closest preceding element
/// that is not a space. The preceding element must be in the same scope as the
/// label, which means that `[Hello #[<label>]]`, for instance, wouldn't work.
///
/// A labelled element can be [referenced]($ref), [queried]($query) for, and
/// [styled]($styling) through its label.
///
/// Once constructed, you can get the name of a label using
/// [`str`]($str/#constructor).
///
/// # Example
/// ```example
/// #show <a>: set text(blue)
/// #show label("b"): set text(red)
///
/// = Heading <a>
/// *Strong* #label("b")
/// ```
///
/// # Syntax
/// This function also has dedicated syntax: You can create a label by enclosing
/// its name in angle brackets. This works both in markup and code. A label's
/// name can contain letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, `:`, and `.`.
///
/// Note that there is a syntactical difference when using the dedicated syntax
/// for this function. In the code below, the `[<a>]` terminates the heading and
/// thus attaches to the heading itself, whereas the `[#label("b")]` is part of
/// the heading and thus attaches to the heading's text.
///
/// ```typ
/// // Equivalent to `#heading[Introduction] <a>`.
/// = Introduction <a>
///
/// // Equivalent to `#heading[Conclusion #label("b")]`.
/// = Conclusion #label("b")
/// ```
///
/// Currently, labels can only be attached to elements in markup mode, not in
/// code mode. This might change in the future.
