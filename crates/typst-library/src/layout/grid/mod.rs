/// Arranges content in a grid.
///
/// The grid element allows you to arrange content in a grid. You can define the
/// number of rows and columns, as well as the size of the gutters between them.
/// There are multiple sizing modes for columns and rows that can be used to
/// create complex layouts.
///
/// While the grid and table elements work very similarly, they are intended for
/// different use cases and carry different semantics. The grid element is
/// intended for presentational and layout purposes, while the [`table`] element
/// is intended for, in broad terms, presenting multiple related data points.
/// Set and show rules on one of these elements do not affect the other. Refer
/// to the [Accessibility Section]($grid/#accessibility) to learn how grids and
/// tables are presented to users of Assistive Technology (AT) like screen
/// readers.
///
/// # Sizing the tracks { #track-size }
///
/// A grid's sizing is determined by the track sizes specified in the arguments.
/// There are multiple sizing parameters: [`columns`]($grid.columns),
/// [`rows`]($grid.rows) and [`gutter`]($grid.gutter).
/// Because each of the sizing parameters accepts the same values, we will
/// explain them just once, here. Each sizing argument accepts an array of
/// individual track sizes. A track size is either:
///
/// - `{auto}`: The track will be sized to fit its contents. It will be at most
///   as large as the remaining space. If there is more than one `{auto}` track
///   width, and together they claim more than the available space, the `{auto}`
///   tracks will fairly distribute the available space among themselves.
///
/// - A fixed or relative length (e.g. `{10pt}` or `{20% - 1cm}`): The track
///   will be exactly of this size.
///
/// - A fractional length (e.g. `{1fr}`): Once all other tracks have been sized,
///   the remaining space will be divided among the fractional tracks according
///   to their fractions. For example, if there are two fractional tracks, each
///   with a fraction of `{1fr}`, they will each take up half of the remaining
///   space.
///
/// To specify a single track, the array can be omitted in favor of a single
/// value. To specify multiple `{auto}` tracks, enter the number of tracks
/// instead of an array. For example, `columns:` `{3}` is equivalent to
/// `columns:` `{(auto, auto, auto)}`.
///
/// # Examples
/// The example below demonstrates the different track sizing options. It also
/// shows how you can use [`grid.cell`] to make an individual cell span two grid
/// tracks.
///
/// ```example
/// // We use `rect` to emphasize the
/// // area of cells.
/// #set rect(
///   inset: 8pt,
///   fill: rgb("e4e5ea"),
///   width: 100%,
/// )
///
/// #grid(
///   columns: (60pt, 1fr, 2fr),
///   rows: (auto, 60pt),
///   gutter: 3pt,
///   rect[Fixed width, auto height],
///   rect[1/3 of the remains],
///   rect[2/3 of the remains],
///   rect(height: 100%)[Fixed height],
///   grid.cell(
///     colspan: 2,
///     image("tiger.jpg", width: 100%),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// You can also [spread]($arguments/#spreading) an array of strings or content
/// into a grid to populate its cells.
///
/// ```example
/// #grid(
///   columns: 5,
///   gutter: 5pt,
///   ..range(25).map(str)
/// )
/// ```
///
/// # Styling the grid { #styling }
/// The grid and table elements work similarly. For a hands-on explanation,
/// refer to the [Table Guide]($guides/tables/#fills); for a quick overview,
/// continue reading.
///
/// The grid's appearance can be customized through different parameters. These
/// are the most important ones:
///
/// - [`align`]($grid.align) to change how cells are aligned
/// - [`inset`]($grid.inset) to optionally add internal padding to cells
/// - [`fill`]($grid.fill) to give cells a background
/// - [`stroke`]($grid.stroke) to optionally enable grid lines with a certain
///   stroke
///
/// To meet different needs, there are various ways to set them.
///
/// If you need to override the above options for individual cells, you can use
/// the [`grid.cell`] element. Likewise, you can override individual grid lines
/// with the [`grid.hline`] and [`grid.vline`] elements.
///
/// To configure an overall style for a grid, you may instead specify the option
/// in any of the following fashions:
///
/// - As a single value that applies to all cells.
/// - As an array of values corresponding to each column. The array will be
///   cycled if there are more columns than the array has items.
/// - As a function in the form of `(x, y) => value`. It receives the cell's
///   column and row indices (both starting from zero) and should return the
///   value to apply to that cell.
///
/// ```example
/// #grid(
///   columns: 5,
///
///   // By a single value
///   align: center,
///   // By a single but more complicated value
///   inset: (x: 2pt, y: 3pt),
///   // By an array of values (cycling)
///   fill: (rgb("#239dad50"), none),
///   // By a function that returns a value
///   stroke: (x, y) => if calc.rem(x + y, 3) == 0 { 0.5pt },
///
///   ..range(5 * 3).map(n => numbering("A", n + 1))
/// )
/// ```
///
/// On top of that, you may [apply styling rules]($styling) to [`grid`] and
/// [`grid.cell`]. Especially, the [`x`]($grid.cell.x) and [`y`]($grid.cell.y)
/// fields of `grid.cell` can be used in a [`where`]($function.where) selector,
/// making it possible to style cells at specific columns or rows, or individual
/// positions.
///
/// ## Stroke styling precedence
/// As explained above, there are three ways to set the stroke of a grid cell:
/// through [`{grid.cell}`'s `stroke` field]($grid.cell.stroke), by using
/// [`{grid.hline}`]($grid.hline) and [`{grid.vline}`]($grid.vline), or by
/// setting the [`{grid}`'s `stroke` field]($grid.stroke). When multiple of
/// these settings are present and conflict, the `hline` and `vline` settings
/// take the highest precedence, followed by the `cell` settings, and finally
/// the `grid` settings.
///
/// Furthermore, strokes of a repeated grid header or footer will take
/// precedence over regular cell strokes.
///
/// # Accessibility
/// Grids do not carry any special semantics. Assistive Technology (AT) does not
/// offer the ability to navigate two-dimensionally by cell in grids. If you
/// want to present tabular data, use the [`table`] element instead.
///
/// AT will read the grid cells in their semantic order. Usually, this is the
/// order in which you passed them to the grid. However, if you manually
/// positioned them using [`grid.cell`'s `x` and `y` arguments]($grid.cell.x),
/// cells will be read row by row, from left to right (in left-to-right
/// documents). A cell will be read when its position is first reached.
